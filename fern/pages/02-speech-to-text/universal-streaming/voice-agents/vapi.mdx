## Recommended settings for optimal latency

### Transcriber settings

For best latency, Format Turns should be turned off (adds about 50ms of delay), and Universal Streaming should be enabled.

### Advanced > Start speaking plan

For start speaking plan, raise the `Wait seconds` to prevent false starts. `Smart Endpointing` should be turned off.
