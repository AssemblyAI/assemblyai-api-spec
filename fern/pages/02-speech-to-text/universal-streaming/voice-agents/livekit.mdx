### Overview

AssemblyAI's end-of-turn detection functionality is integrated into our Streaming STT model, leveraging both acoustic and semantic features, and is coupled with a traditional silence-based heuristic approach. Both mechanisms work jointly and either can trigger end-of-turn detection throughout the audio stream. This joint approach significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of end-of-turn detection while allowing this functionality to fall back to the traditional method when the model makes a misprediction.

<Note>
  End-of-turn and end-of-utterances refer to the same thing and may be used
  interchangeably in these docs.

### Model-based detection

Triggers when **all** conditions are met:

#### EOT token predicted

- Model predicts semantic end-of-turn with a probability greater than `end_of_turn_confidence_threshold`
- Default: 0.5 (user configurable)

#### Minimum silence duration has passed

- After the last non-silence word token, `min_end_of_turn_silence_when_confident` milliseconds must pass
- Default: 400ms (user configurable)

#### Minimum speech duration spoken

- The user must speak for at least 80ms since the last end-of-turn (ensures at least one word)
- Set to 80 ms (internal)

#### Word finalized

- Last word in `turn.words` has been finalized
- Internal configuration

### Silence-based detection

Triggers when **all** conditions are met:

#### Minimum speech duration spoken

- The user must speak for at least 80ms since the last end-of-turn (ensures at least one word)
- Set to 80 ms (internal)

#### Maximum silence duration has passed

- After the last non-silence word token, `max_turn_silence` milliseconds must pass
- Default: 2400ms (user configurable)

### Important notes

- Silence-based detection can override model-based detection even with high EOT confidence thresholds
- Word finalization always takes precedence â€” endpointing won't occur until the last word is finalized
- We define end-of-turn detection as the process of detecting the end of sustained speech activity, often called end-pointing in the Voice Agents context
