  Agent with Pipecat and AssemblyAI
  guide](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-to-text/pipecat-intro-guide).
</Note>

## Overview

Pipecat is an open source platform for developers building realtime media applications. In this guide, we'll show you how to integrate AssemblyAI's streaming speech-to-text model into your Pipecat voice agent using the Pipeline framework.

## Quickstart

<Tip title="Looking for a full code example?">
  See our Pipecat tutorial guide
  [here](/docs/speech-to-text/pipecat-intro-guide).
</Tip>

### Installation

Install the AssemblyAI service from PyPI:

```bash
pip install "pipecat-ai[assemblyai]"
```

### Authentication

The AssemblyAI service requires an [AssemblyAI API key](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/overview#authorization). Set `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file.

<Tip>
  You can obtain an AssemblyAI API key by signing up
  [here](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup).
</Tip>

### Basic usage

Use AssemblyAI STT in a `Pipeline`:

```python
from pipecat.services.assemblyai.stt import AssemblyAISTTService, AssemblyAIConnectionParams

# Configure service
stt = AssemblyAISTTService(
    api_key=os.getenv("ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"),
    vad_force_turn_endpoint=False,  # Use AssemblyAI's STT-based turn detection
    connection_params=AssemblyAIConnectionParams(
        end_of_turn_confidence_threshold=0.7,
        min_end_of_turn_silence_when_confident=160,
        max_turn_silence=2400,
    )
)

# Use in pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    transport.input(),
    stt,
    llm,
    tts,
    transport.output(),
])
```

## Configuration

### Turn Detection (Key Feature)

AssemblyAI's new turn detection model was built specifically for voice agents and you can tweak it to fit your use case. It processes both audio and linguistic information to determine an end of turn confidence score on every inference, and if that confidence score is past the set threshold, it triggers end of turn.

This custom model was designed to address 2 major issues with voice agents. With traditional VAD (voice activity detection) approaches based on silence alone, there are situations where the agent wouldn't wait for a user to finish their turn even if the audio data suggested it. Think of a situation like "My credit card number is\_\_\_\_" - if someone is looking that up, traditional VAD may not wait for the user, where our turn detection model is far better in these situations.

Additionally, in situations where we are certain that the user is done speaking like "What is my credit score?", a high end of turn confidence is returned, greater than the threshold, and triggering end of turn, allowing for minimal turnaround latency in those scenarios.

You can set the `vad_force_turn_endpoint` parameter within the `AssemblyAISTTService` constructor:

```python
stt = AssemblyAISTTService(
    api_key=os.getenv("ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"),
    vad_force_turn_endpoint=False,  # Use AssemblyAI's STT-based turn detection
    connection_params=AssemblyAIConnectionParams(
        end_of_turn_confidence_threshold=0.7,
        min_end_of_turn_silence_when_confident=160,  # in ms
        max_turn_silence=2400,  # in ms
    )
)
```

**Parameter tuning:**

- **end_of_turn_confidence_threshold**: Raise or lower the threshold based on how confident you'd like us to be before triggering end of turn based on confidence score
- **min_end_of_turn_silence_when_confident**: Increase or decrease the amount of time we wait to trigger end of turn when confident
- **max_turn_silence**: Lower or raise the amount of time needed to trigger end of turn when end of turn isn't triggered by a high confidence score

<Tip>
  You can also set `vad_force_turn_endpoint=True` if you'd like turn detection
  to be based on VAD instead of our advanced turn detection model.

## Parameters

### Constructor Parameters

<ParamField path="api_key" type="str" required>
  Your AssemblyAI API key.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="connection_params" type="AssemblyAIConnectionParams">
  Connection parameters for the AssemblyAI WebSocket connection. See below for
  details.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="vad_force_turn_endpoint" type="bool" default="True">
  When true, sends a `ForceEndpoint` event to AssemblyAI when a
  `UserStoppedSpeakingFrame` is received. Requires a VAD (Voice Activity
  Detection) processor in the pipeline to generate these frames.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="language" type="Language" default="Language.EN">
  Language for transcription. AssemblyAI currently only supports English
  Streaming transcription.
</ParamField>

### Connection Parameters

<ParamField path="sample_rate" type="int" default="16000">
  The sample rate of the audio stream
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="encoding" type="str" default="pcm_s16le">
  The encoding of the audio stream. Allowed values: `pcm_s16le`, `pcm_mulaw`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="format_turns" type="bool" default="True">
  Whether to return formatted final transcripts. If enabled, formatted final
  transcripts will be emitted shortly following an end-of-turn detection.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="end_of_turn_confidence_threshold" type="float" default="0.7">
  The confidence threshold to use when determining if the end of a turn has been
  reached.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
  path="min_end_of_turn_silence_when_confident"
  type="int"
  default="160"
>
  The minimum amount of silence required to detect end of turn when confident.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="max_turn_silence" type="int" default="2400">
  The maximum amount of silence allowed in a turn before end of turn is
  triggered.
</ParamField>
