### Common session errors and closures

In WebSocket based connections, closures and errors represent different ways a connection can terminate.
A closure is a normal, expected termination initiated by either the client or the server, whereas errors are terminations resulting from an unexpected problem like network issues, protocol mismatches, timeouts, or server-side issues.
In the event of an error, the `on_error` callback is triggered just prior to `on_close`. **If an error is not encountered, then only `on_close` is called.**

When a session closes, the `on_close` callback receives a status code and reason detailing why the connection ended.
This information is useful when attempting to debug issues or handle certain closure scenarios programmatically.
The below table lists some of the common reasons for a session closure along with their corresponding codes and descriptions.

<Note title="Handling closed sessions">
  A common way to handle a closure such as `3005 - Session Expired: Maximum session duration exceeded` is to parse the status code and reason in the `on_close` callback. If a specific code and reason are detected, you can then take appropriate action, such as opening a new session or logging useful debugging information.

Note that the `on_error` callback is not triggered in this case, as the session closes for a known reason and not due to encountering an error.

</Note>
If you believe your session received an error or closed due to a reason not listed above, please reach out to support@assemblyai.com with the [session id](/docs/api-reference/streaming-api/streaming-api#receive.receiveSessionBegins.id) and any further details.
