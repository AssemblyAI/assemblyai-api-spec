# Keyterms prompting for Universal-Streaming

The keyterms prompting feature helps improve recognition accuracy for specific words and phrases that are important to your use case.

<Warning>

Keyterms Prompting costs an additional $0.04/hour.

## Configuration

To utilize keyterms prompting, you need to include your desired keyterms as query parameters in the WebSocket URL.

- You can include a maximum of 100 keyterms per session.
- Each individual keyterm string must be 50 characters or less in length.

## How it works

Streaming Keyterms Prompting has two components to improve accuracy for your terms.

### Word-level boosting

The streaming model itself is biased during inference to be more accurate at identifying words from your keyterms list. This happens in real-time as words are emitted during the streaming process, providing immediate improvements to recognition accuracy. This component is enabled by default.

### Turn-level boosting

After each turn is completed, an additional boosting pass analyzes the full transcript using your keyterms list. This post-processing step, similar to formatting, provides a second layer of accuracy improvement by examining the complete context of the turn. To enable this component, set `format_turns` to `True`.

Both stages work together to maximize recognition accuracy for your keyterms throughout the streaming process.

## Dynamic keyterms prompting

Dynamic keyterms prompting allows you to update keyterms during an active streaming session using the `UpdateConfiguration` message. This enables you to adapt the recognition context in real-time based on conversation flow or changing requirements.

### Updating keyterms during a session

To update keyterms while streaming, send an `UpdateConfiguration` message with a new `keyterms_prompt` array:

<Tabs>

<Tab language="python" title="Python">

```python
# Replace or establish new set of keyterms
websocket.send('{"type": "UpdateConfiguration", "keyterms_prompt": ["Universal-3"]}')

# Remove keyterms and reset context biasing
websocket.send('{"type": "UpdateConfiguration", "keyterms_prompt": []}')
```

</Tab>

<Tab language="javascript" title="Javascript">

```javascript
// Replace or establish new set of keyterms
websocket.send('{"type": "UpdateConfiguration", "keyterms_prompt": ["Universal-3"]}');

// Remove keyterms and reset context biasing
websocket.send('{"type": "UpdateConfiguration", "keyterms_prompt": []}');
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### How dynamic keyterms work

When you send an `UpdateConfiguration` message:

- **Replacing keyterms**: Providing a new array of keyterms completely replaces the existing set. The new keyterms take effect immediately for subsequent audio processing.
- **Clearing keyterms**: Sending an empty array `[]` removes all keyterms and resets context biasing to the default state.
- **Both boosting stages**: Dynamic keyterms work with both word-level boosting (native context biasing) and turn-level boosting (metaphone-based), just like initial keyterms.

### Use cases for dynamic keyterms

Dynamic keyterms are particularly useful for:

- **Context-aware voice agents**: Update keyterms based on conversation stage (e.g., switching from menu items to payment terms)
- **Multi-topic conversations**: Adapt vocabulary as the conversation topic changes
- **Progressive disclosure**: Add relevant keyterms as new information becomes available
- **Cleanup**: Remove keyterms that are no longer relevant to reduce processing overhead

## Important notes

- Keyterms prompts longer than 50 characters are ignored.
- Requests containing more than 100 keyterms will result in an error.

## Best practices

To maximize the effectiveness of keyterms prompting:

- Specify Unique Terminology: Include proper names, company names, technical terms, or vocabulary specific to your domain that might not be commonly recognized.
- Exact Spelling and Capitalization: Provide keyterms with the precise spelling and capitalization you expect to see in the output transcript. This helps the system accurately identify the terms.
- Avoid Common Words: Do not include single, common English words (e.g., "information") as keyterms. The system is generally proficient with such words, and adding them as keyterms can be redundant.
