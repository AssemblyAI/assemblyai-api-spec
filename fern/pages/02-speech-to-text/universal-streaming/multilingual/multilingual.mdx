Multilingual streaming allows you to transcribe audio streams in multiple languages.

## Configuration

<Warning>
    Keyterms prompting is not supported with multilingual streaming.
</Warning>

To utilize multilingual streaming, you need to include `"speech_model":"universal-streaming-multilingual"` as a query parameter in the WebSocket URL.

### Supported languages

Multilingual currently supports  English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese.

# Understanding formatting

The multilingual model produces transcripts with punctuation and capitalization already built into the model outputs. This means you'll receive properly formatted text without requiring any additional post-processing.

<Note>
    While the API still returns the `turn_is_formatted` parameter to maintain interface consistency with other streaming models, the multilingual model doesn't perform additional formatting operations. All transcripts from the multilingual model are already formatted as they're generated.
</Note>

In the future, this built-in formatting capability will be extended to our English-only streaming model as well.
