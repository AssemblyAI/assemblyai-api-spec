Use prompt engineering to control transcription style and improve accuracy for domain-specific terminology. This guide documents best practices for crafting effective prompts for Universal-3-Pro speech transcription.

## How prompting works

Universal-3-Pro is a Speech-augmented Large Language Model (SpeechLLM). The architecture is a multi-modal LLM with an audio encoder and LLM decoder designed to understand and process speech, audio, and text inputs in the same workflow.

SpeechLLM prompting works more like **selecting modes and knobs** than open-ended instruction following. The model is trained primarily to transcribe, then fine-tuned to respond to common transcription instructions for style, speakers, and speech events.

### What prompts can do

| Capability | Description | Reliability |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Verbatim transcription and disfluencies** | Include um, uh, false starts, repetitions, stutters | High |
| **Output style and formatting** | Control punctuation, capitalization, number formatting | High |
| **Context aware clues** | Help with jargon, names, and domain expectations | Medium |
| **Entity accuracy and spelling** | Improve accuracy for proper nouns, brands, technical terms | Medium |
| **Speaker attribution** | Mark speaker turns and add labels | High |
| **Audio event tags** | Mark laughter, music, applause, background sounds | Medium |
| **Code-switching and multilingual** | Handle multilingual audio in same transcript | Medium |
| **Numbers and measurements** | Control how numbers, percentages, and measurements are formatted | Medium |
| **Difficult audio handling** | Guidance for unclear audio, overlapping speech, interruptions | Medium |

### What prompts cannot reliably do

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| **Invent correct spellings** | Unknown rare words need hotwords or context injection |
| **Resolve ambiguous audio** | The model transcribes what it hears, not what it infers |
| **Perfect proper nouns** | Rare names and entities may need a post-processing LLM correction step |
| **Code-switch and Translate** | Code-switching preserves language or translates, not both |

For consistent proper-noun accuracy or domain vocabulary, you'll usually need **context injection into the prompt**, use [keyterms prompt](/docs/pre-recorded-audio/improving-transcript-results-with-keyterms-prompting) to highlight known keyterms, or a **post-processing LLM correction step**.

## Prompt capabilities

Each capability below acts as a "knob" you can turn. Combine 3-6 capabilities maximum for best results.

### 1. Verbatim transcription and disfluencies

**What it does:** Preserves natural speech patterns including filler words, false starts, repetitions, and self-corrections.

**Reliability:** High

**Example prompts:**

```text
Include spoken filler words like "um," "uh," "you know," "like," plus repetitions
and false starts when clearly spoken.
```

```text
Preserve all disfluencies exactly as spoken including verbal hesitations,
restarts, and self-corrections (um, uh, I—I mean).
```

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was— I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
```

---

### 2. Output style and formatting

**What it does:** Controls punctuation, capitalization, and readability without changing words.

**Reliability:** High

**Example prompts:**

```text
Transcribe this audio with beautiful punctuation and formatting.
```

```text
Use expressive punctuation to reflect emotion and prosody.
```

```text
Use standard punctuation and sentence breaks for readability.
```

---

### 3. Context aware clues

**What it does:** Helps with jargon, names, and domain expectations that are known from the audio file.

**Reliability:** Medium

**Example prompts:**

```text
Transcribe this audio. Context: a customer testimonial about contact center software.
```

```text
Transcribe this audio. Context: a medical consultation discussing medications and symptoms.
```

```text
Transcribe this audio. Context: a technical lecture about GPUs, CUDA, and inference.
```

---

### 4. Entity accuracy and spelling

**What it does:** Improves accuracy for proper nouns, brands, technical terms, and domain vocabulary.

**Reliability:** Medium (works best with explicit examples)

**Example prompts:**

```text
Use standard spelling and the most contextually correct spelling of all words
including names, brands, drug names, medical terms, and proper nouns.
```

```text
Non-negotiable: Pharmaceutical accuracy required (omeprazole over omeprizole,
metformin over metforman).
```

```text
Preserve acronyms and capitalization (EBITDA over ebitda, API over A.P.I.).
```

**Caution:** Over instructing the model to follow examples can cause hallucinations when these examples are encountered.

---

### 5. Speaker attribution

**What it does:** Marks speaker turns and adds identifying labels.

**Reliability:** High

**Example prompts:**

```text
Mark speaker turns clearly.
```

```text
Tag speaker changes with context like name, role, or gender based on speech content.
```

```text
Label speakers by role when identifiable (Justice Roberts:, Petitioner's Counsel:).
```

Speaker labels can be tagged with names, roles, genders, and more from the audio file. Simply add the desired category for the labels into your prompt.

---

### 6. Audio event tags

**What it does:** Marks non-speech sounds like music, laughter, applause, and background noise.

**Reliability:** Medium

**Example prompts:**

```text
Preserve non-speech audio in tags to indicate when the audio occurred.
```

```text
Tag sounds: [laughter], [silence], [noise], [cough], [sigh].
```

```text
Include audio event markers for music, laughter, and applause.
```

---

### 7. Code-switching and multilingual

**What it does:** Handles audio where speakers switch between languages.

**Reliability:** Medium

**Example prompts:**

```text
Transcribe in the original language mix (code-switching), preserving words
in the language they are spoken.
```

```text
Preserve natural code-switching between English and Spanish. Retain spoken
language as-is (correct "I was hablando con mi manager").
```

**Note:** Requires `language_detection: true` on your request. If a single language code is specified, the model will try to transcribe only that language.

---

### 8. Numbers and measurements

**What it does:** Controls how numbers, percentages, and measurements are formatted.

**Reliability:** Medium

**Example prompts:**

```text
Convert spoken numbers to digits.
```

```text
Use digits for numbers, percentages, and measurements.
```

```text
Format financial figures with standard notation (Q3 revenue over third quarter revenue).
```

---

### 9. Difficult audio handling

**What it does:** Provides guidance for unclear audio, overlapping speech, and interruptions.

**Reliability:** Medium (YMMV)

**Example prompts:**

```text
If unintelligible, write (unclear).
```

```text
Mark inaudible segments. Preserve overlapping speech and crosstalk.
```

```text
Include pause markers where the speaker hesitates significantly.
```

## Best practices

### What helps

| Practice | Impact | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Authoritative language** | Massive | `Mandatory:`, `Non-negotiable:`, `Required:` |
| **3-6 instructions maximum** | Massive | Prevents conflicting instructions |
| **Desired output examples** | High | `Use proper medical medication names (omeprazole)` |
| **Explicit disfluency examples** | High | `(um, uh, like, you know)` |

### What hurts

| Anti-pattern | Impact | Why it fails |
|--------------|--------|--------------|
| **Negative language** | Severe | "Don't", "never", "avoid" confuse the model |
| **Conflicting instructions** | Severe | "Include disfluencies" + "clean grammar" |
| **Short, vague instructions** | High | Lack specificity for model to learn from |
| **Missing disfluency instructions** | High | Model defaults to readable transcription |

## Domain-specific sample prompts

### Legal transcription

Best for: Court proceedings, depositions, legal hearings

```text
Mandatory: Transcribe legal proceedings with precise terminology intact.

Required: Preserve all disfluencies including verbal pauses, false starts, and
self-corrections (uh, um, I—I mean over cleaned speech).

Non-negotiable: Distinguish between speakers through clear attribution
(Justice Roberts: over generic labels).

Capture Latin legal phrases exactly as spoken (certiorari, habeas corpus,
amicus curiae).
```

**Why it works:** Combines authoritative language (Mandatory, Required, Non-negotiable), explicit disfluency examples with contrast format, speaker attribution guidance, and domain terminology.

---

### Medical transcription

Best for: Clinical consultations, medical dictation, patient encounters

```text
Mandatory: Preserve all clinical terminology exactly as spoken including drug
names, dosages, and diagnostic terms.

Required: Capture every hesitation, false start, and filler word (um, uh, ah)
as spoken.

Non-negotiable: Pharmaceutical accuracy (omeprazole over omeprizole,
metformin over metforman, hypertension over high blood pressure).

Label physician and patient speech clearly when identifiable.
```

**Why it works:** Prioritizes medical accuracy with explicit drug name examples showing error patterns, while preserving verbatim speech for documentation compliance.

---

### Financial/Earnings calls

Best for: Quarterly earnings calls, investor presentations, financial meetings

```text
Mandatory: Corporate earnings call transcription with precise financial
terminology.

Required: Preserve all speaker disfluencies including hesitations, false starts,
and filler words (um, uh, you know) exactly as spoken.

Non-negotiable: Financial term accuracy (EBITDA over ebitda, year-over-year
over y-o-y, basis points over bps).

Format numerical data with standard notation. Label executive speakers by role
when identifiable (CEO:, CFO:, Analyst:).
```

**Why it works:** Balances financial terminology precision with verbatim capture of executive speech patterns important for tone analysis.

---

### Software/Technical meetings

Best for: Engineering standups, code reviews, technical discussions

```text
Mandatory: Technical meeting transcription with multiple participants.

Required: Preserve all verbal disfluencies including hesitations, false starts,
and thinking sounds (um, uh, hmm, so) exactly as spoken.

Non-negotiable: Technical terminology accuracy (Kubernetes over kubernetties,
PostgreSQL over postgres, API over A.P.I.).

Mark speaker transitions explicitly. Capture self-corrections and restarts
(I was— I went, th-that).
```

**Why it works:** Preserves natural developer speech patterns while ensuring technical terms are spelled correctly.

---

### Code-switching (Bilingual)

Best for: Multilingual conversations, Spanglish, language mixing

```text
Mandatory: Transcribe verbatim, preserving natural code-switching between
English and Spanish.

Required: Retain spoken language as-is without translation
(correct "I was hablando con mi manager").

Non-negotiable: Preserve fillers, repetitions, and false starts across both
languages (eh, o sea— I mean, you know).

Resolve sound-alike errors using bilingual context (pero over perro,
meeting over mitin).
```

**Why it works:** Explicitly instructs preservation over translation, handles cross-language disfluencies, and addresses common bilingual transcription errors.

## How to build your prompt

### Step 1: Start with your base need

Choose your primary transcription goal:

| Goal | Base instruction |
|------|------------------|
| **Verbatim/disfluencies** | `Include spoken filler words, hesitations, plus repetitions and false starts when clearly spoken.` |
| **Output style/formatting** | `Transcribe this audio with beautiful punctuation and formatting.` |
| **Context aware clues** | `Transcribe this audio. Context: [describe the audio content and domain].` |
| **Entity accuracy** | `Use standard spelling and contextually correct spelling of all proper nouns.` |
| **Speaker attribution** | `Mark speaker turns clearly. Tag speaker changes with context like name, role, or gender.` |
| **Audio event tags** | `Preserve non-speech audio in tags to indicate when the audio occurred.` |
| **Code-switching** | `Transcribe in the original language mix, preserving words in the language spoken.` |
| **Numbers/measurements** | `Use digits for numbers, percentages, and measurements.` |
| **Difficult audio** | `If unintelligible, write (unclear). Mark inaudible segments.` |

### Step 2: Add authoritative language

Prefix each instruction with:
- `Non-negotiable:`
- `Mandatory:`
- `Required:`
- `Strict requirement:`

### Step 3: Add instructions one by one

We recommend you layer on each instruction one by one to see the impact on the transcription output. Since conflicting instructions can cause outputs to degrade, adding each instruction one by one allows you to test and evaluate how each instruction improves/degrades your transcription output.

### Step 4: Iterate and test

1. **Identify target terms** - What words/phrases are being transcribed incorrectly?
2. **Find the error pattern** - Vowel substitution? Sound-alike? Phonetic spelling?
3. **Choose example terms** - Pick 2-3 common terms with the SAME error pattern
4. **Test and verify** - Listen to the audio to confirm correctness
5. **Measure success rate** - Test variations on sample files

### Final prompt structure

```text
[Authoritative language]: [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
[Authoritative language]: [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
[Authoritative language]: [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
```
