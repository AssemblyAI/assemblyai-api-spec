import { PromptGenerator } from "../../../assets/components/PromptGenerator";

Use prompt engineering to control transcription style and improve accuracy for domain-specific terminology. This guide documents best practices for crafting effective prompts for Universal-3-Pro speech transcription, based on extensive testing (~1,000+ prompt variations).

## Prompt generator

This prompt generator helps you create a starting prompt based on your selected transcription style. Paste a sample of your transcript and select your preferred style to get a customized prompt recommendation from your preferred LLM. Note LLMs will still be learning to index this content, so you may need to experiment some to get the best output.

<PromptGenerator />

## Core prompt principles

### The winning prompt structure

```text
[Base instruction]
[Pushy, authoritative language] + [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
[Pushy, authoritative language] + [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
[Pushy, authoritative language] + [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
[Audio tags instruction]
```

All five components matter, but examples are critical to drive changes in transcription output:

| Principle | Implementation | Impact |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Explicit examples** | Show 2-3 examples of the error pattern being corrected | Massive |
| **Pushy, authoritative language** | Use "Non-negotiable", "Mandatory", "Strict requirement" | Critical |
| **Specific instruction** | State exactly what accuracy you need | High |
| **Keep concise** | 3-5 instructions maximum | High |

### Keep it concise

Limit prompts to 3-5 instructions maximum (including base instruction). Overly verbose/long prompts don't improve accuracy. Each instruction should be actionable and specific.

### Show, don't just tell

The model learns **error patterns** from examples, not just specific words. When you show:

```text
Fix vowel substitution errors in pharmaceutical terms (omeprazole not omeprizole, metformin not metforman)
```

The model learns: "Fix vowel substitution errors in pharmaceutical terms" and applies this to ALL drugs in the transcript, including ones not in your examples.

## Prompt components

### Base transcription instructions

Choose based on your transcription needs:

| Style | Base instruction | Use for |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Readability** | `Transcribe audio verbatim.` | Transcript readabilitiy, Removes speech errors |
| **Readable with disfluencies** | `Transcribe audio verbatim:`<br/>`- Include all disfluencies` | Conversational accuracy, Capturing basic speech patterns |
| **Full verbatim** | `Transcribe verbatim:`<br/>`- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)`<br/>`- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)`<br/>`- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)`<br/>`- False starts: yes (I was- I went)` | Maximum speech accuracy, Linguistic analysis of transcript |

### Pushy, authoritative language

The model responds to authoritative, non-negotiable language. Use one of:

| Phrase | Effectiveness |
|--------|---------------|
| `Non-negotiable:` | High |
| `Mandatory:` | High |
| `Strict requirement:` | High |
| `Must follow:` | Medium-High |
| `Required:` | Medium-High |

### Specific transcription instructions

Based on the content of your audio file, you should understand the common speech patterns of your end users. You will want to provide these patterns as instructions for the model to focus on.

Some specific instructions include concepts like:

| Specific instruction | Use for |
|------------------|-------|
| `Non-negotiable: Pharmaceutical accuracy required (omeprazole not omeprizole, metformin not metforman)` | Max accuracy of pharmaceutical drugs |
| `Mandatory: Respect patient's medical history (IBD, Chron's)` | Max accuracy of any terms related to patient's specific condition(s) listed |
| `Strict requirement: All diseases and prescriptions must be found in common reference materials (aminosalicylates not aminoselicylates)` | Max accuracy of medical prognosis to training data |

### Explicit examples of tanscript corrections

#### Why examples work

The model learns **error patterns** from examples, not just specific words. When you show:

```text
(omeprazole not omeprizole, metformin not metforman)
```

The model learns: "Fix vowel substitution errors in pharmaceutical terms" and applies this to ALL drugs, including ones not in your examples.

#### How to construct examples

1. **Identify the error pattern** in your domain (vowel swaps, similar-sounding words, acronyms for common words, etc.)
2. **Choose 2-3 common terms** where this error frequently occurs (they do not need to be in the audio file, but representative of the issue)
3. **Show correct to incorrect** format: `(correct not incorrect)`

#### Example patterns by error type

| Error type | Example format |
|------------|----------------|
| Vowel substitution | `(omeprazole not omeprizole)` |
| Sound-alike confusion | `(CABG not cabbage)` |
| Phonetic spelling | `(prescription not perscription)` |
| Technical terms | `(kubernetes not kubernetties)` |
| Proper nouns | `(Salesforce not sales force)` |

### Audio tags

The model will attempt to capture non-speech events in the audio with audio tags. You can choose to include these by prompting an instructions for audio tag inclusion.

```text
Tag sounds: [laughter], [silence], [noise], [cough], [sigh].
```

When there is a pause in the speech where a non-speech sound is detected, audio tags will be added like `[NOISE]`, `[MUSIC]`, `[APPLAUSE]`, etc.

## Prompts components that don't work

Based on testing, avoid these patterns:

### Context setting

Context phrases like `Context: Medical transcription` provide marginal benefit at best.

Context is not a substitute for concrete examples. If you're limited on prompt length, prioritize examples over context.

### Role priming

Role phrases like `You are a pharmacist reviewer` provide marginal benefit at best.

Role phrases work best when combined with affirmative language like `You are a superstar doctor with world class diagnosis skills`. Generally you are better off prioritizing examples over role priming.

### Vague instructions without examples

```text
Use correct medical terminology.
Transcribe accurately.
Be precise with drug names.
```

With no error pattern for the model to learn from, these examples will only provide marginal benefits to accuracy.

### Overly short or long prompts

We found in testing the sweet spot for length is:
- 3-5 instructions
- 50-80 words

#### Overly long prompts

```text
You are a medical transcriptionist with 20 years of experience.
Your job is to accurately transcribe medical dictation...
[continues for 10 more lines]
```

With longer prompts with more instructions, the instructions start to conflict one another. The model thus starts to degragde in transcription quality versus improve as it tries to process conflicting instructions.

#### Overly short prompts

```text
Use correct medical terminology.
Transcribe accurately.
Be precise with drug names.
```

With shorter prompts with less examples, the model struggles to produce corrections since there are not enough examples to draw on. Transcription quality won't degrade, but it won't be as accurate as it would be with explicit examples.

### Polite, non-authoritative language

```text
Please try to use correct spelling.
If possible, verify drug names.
It would be nice to have accurate terms.
```

The model doesn't prioritize non-authoritative requests well. The instruction will be followed weakly versus others provided and is less likely to override the base model's system prompts.

### Examples of what you DON'T want only

```text
Don't write "omeprizole" or "metforman"
```

Examples need what you WANT to see. If you only include what you don't want, the model won't know what changes to make to transcription.

## How to build your prompt

### Step 1: Choose your base

- Readability: `Transcribe verbatim.`
- Readable with disfluencies: `Transcribe verbatim:\n- Include all disfluencies`
- Full verbatim: `Transcribe verbatim:\n- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)\n- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)\n- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)\n- False starts: yes (I was- I went)`

### Step 2: Add pushy, authoritative language

- `Non-negotiable:` / `Mandatory:` / `Strict requirement:` / `Required:`

### Step 3: State the specific instruction

- `Pharmaceutical accuracy required`
- `Legal terminology accuracy`
- `Technical term precision`

### Step 4: Add 2-3 explicit examples per specific instruction

- `(correct not incorrect, correct2 not incorrect2)`

### Final prompt format

```text
[Base instruction]
[Pushy, authoritative language] + [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
[Pushy, authoritative language] + [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
[Pushy, authoritative language] + [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
[Audio tags instruction]
```

## Testing your prompts

1. **Identify your target terms** - What specific words/phrases are being transcribed incorrectly?
2. **Find the error pattern** - Is it vowel substitution? Sound-alike confusion? Phonetic spelling? Make this your set of specific instructions.
3. **Choose example terms** - Pick 2-3 common terms with the SAME error pattern (not the exact terms you're trying to fix, but examples the model can draw from).
4. **Test and human verify** - The model is often times capturing verbatim transcription humans struggle with. You will need to listen to the file and determine correctness vs the output.
5. **Measure success rate** - Evaluate a few prompt variations on sample files and confirm what works best.

## Prompt engineering walkthrough: Virtual meeting

This walkthrough demonstrates how different prompts affect transcription output using a real virtual business meeting recording. The baseline is Universal-3-Pro without any prompt, which produces clean, readable transcription with 4,418 words. To listen along as you use this guide, access the [GitLab virtual meeting here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOqgRiNMVqg).

### Baseline vs prompts comparison

The following examples show how prompts can increase or decrease verbosity compared to the baseline. Each example uses the same audio file to demonstrate the effect of different prompt formulations. 

**Source audio:** Virtual business meeting (team staff meeting)

| Prompt type | Words | Change vs baseline |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| Baseline (no prompt) | 4,418 | — |
| Basic disfluencies | 4,698 | +280 (+6.3%) |
| Enhanced disfluencies | 4,709 | +291 (+6.6%) |
| Maximum verbatim | 4,753 | +335 (+7.6%) |
| Maximum verbatim with audio tags | 4,820 | +402 (+9.1%) |

### Basic disfluency prompt

Use this prompt when you need to capture conversational disfluencies while maintaining readability.

```text
This is a virtual business meeting. Transcribe the audio verbatim, including all disfluencies and false starts.
```

This prompt adds filler words like "um" and "uh" to the output and captures false starts with em-dashes. That being said, as it has no explicit examples, it doesn't transcribe everything:
- Readability of disfluencies is prioritized over verbatim
  - If it finds repeated "uh uh uh" it will only transcribe a single filler word
  - If filler words are considered disfluencies like "like", it may or may not capture them correctly
- For false starts, performance is varied
  - If there is a false start or studder, there is no example how those should be handled in the output

### Enhanced disfluency prompt

Use this prompt for aggressive disfluency capture with explicit emphasis. This tries to maintain readability with emphasis on capturing all speech patterns.

```text
This is a virtual business meeting. Transcribe the audio verbatim, overly trying to capture hesitations, disfluencies, and false starts. This should be as close to a human transcriptionist as possible.
```

Using intensifying language like "overly trying" and comparing to a human transcriptionist increases capture rates. However, the lack of explicit examples prevents this prompt from capturing all of the potential known speech challenges inside the file.

### Maximum verbatim prompt

Use this prompt when you need the highest fidelity transcription with all speech patterns captured.

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
```

Providing concrete examples of disfluencies to capture produces the highest word count and captures repeated hesitations. This is ideal for human level verbatim transcription and communication pattern analysis.

### Key observations

The walkthrough demonstrates several important patterns:

1. **Concrete examples drive behavior** - The maximum verbatim prompt includes specific examples like "um, uhs, you know, stud-stud-studder" which produces the highest disfluency capture rate.

2. **Intensifying language works** - Phrases like "overly trying" and "as close to a human transcriptionist as possible" measurably increase capture rates.

3. **Bidirectional control** - You can move in both directions: more verbose with disfluency prompts or cleaner with readability-focused prompts.

4. **Consistent patterns** - The same audio produces consistently different outputs based on prompt formulation, demonstrating reliable prompt engineering effects.

## Use case templates

The following templates are optimized for specific industries and applications. Each includes recommended prompts and common error patterns to address.

### AI-powered meeting intelligence

**Use case**: Transcribing business meetings for summaries, action items, and searchable archives.

**Common errors**: Company names, product names, project codenames, attendee names, acronyms.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Proper noun accuracy (Salesforce not sales force, Asana not a sauna, Figma not fig ma)
```

**Minimal (for polished summaries only):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. Non-negotiable: Product and company name accuracy (Kubernetes not kubernetties, Elasticsearch not elastic search, MongoDB not mongo DB)
```

**Tips:**
- Use full verbatim for raw transcripts; minimal for auto-summarization pipelines
- Add your specific company/product names as examples if they're commonly misheard
- For recurring meetings, identify which terms get mangled and add those as examples

### Call centers and contact centers

**Use case**: Customer service calls, support tickets, quality assurance, compliance monitoring.

**Common errors**: Product names, policy terms, ticket/case numbers, customer account references.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim - required for compliance):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Policy term accuracy (warranty not warrenty, reimbursement not reimbersment, eligibility not eligability)
```

**For compliance-focused transcription:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Customer service accuracy (cancellation not cancelation, subscription not subsciption, representative not representive)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim is critical for compliance - captures exact phrasing like "I, uh, I guess I agree" vs "I agree"
- Disfluencies reveal customer confusion (false starts), frustration (repetitions), hesitation (fillers)
- Replace examples with your product-specific terms that get misheard

### Call tracking and analytics

**Use case**: Marketing attribution, lead tracking, campaign performance analysis.

**Common errors**: Campaign names, promo codes, URL mentions, phone numbers spoken aloud.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Marketing term accuracy (referral not referal, campaign not campain, promotional not promotial)
```

**Minimal (for analytics pipelines):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. Strict requirement: Alphanumeric accuracy for codes and references. Marketing terminology (coupon not cupon, discount not disount)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim captures caller intent signals (hesitation before providing info)
- If tracking specific campaign names, add them as examples
- Promo codes are challenging - consider post-processing validation

### Education

**Use case**: Lecture transcription, tutoring sessions, educational content, accessibility.

**Common errors**: Academic terminology, subject-specific vocabulary, citation references.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim - for tutoring/interactive sessions):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Academic terminology accuracy (curriculum not curiculum, pedagogy not pedogogy, assessment not assesment)
```

**For STEM lectures (polished output):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. Strict requirement: Scientific term accuracy (algorithm not algorythm, hypothesis not hypothesus, variable not varable)
```

**For humanities:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. MANDATORY: Academic vocabulary (bibliography not bibilography, dissertation not disertation, methodology not methodolgy)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim for tutoring captures student thinking process and confusion points
- Minimal works for polished lecture recordings meant for captions
- For language learning content, disfluencies are pedagogically valuable - use full verbatim
- Different subjects have different terminology - customize examples per course/subject

### Hiring and recruiting

**Use case**: Interview transcription, candidate screening, hiring analytics.

**Common errors**: Job titles, company names, technical skills, certifications.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim - critical for interview analysis):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Professional terminology accuracy (LinkedIn not linked in, resume not resumay, candidate not canadate)
```

**For technical roles:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Technical skill accuracy (JavaScript not java script, PostgreSQL not post-gress, Kubernetes not kubernetties)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim is essential - hesitations, self-corrections, and false starts reveal candidate thinking patterns
- Stutters on technical questions vs fluent answers are meaningful signals
- Add role-specific technical terms as examples based on job requirements

### Online meeting platforms

**Use case**: General video conferencing transcription, closed captions, meeting records.

**Common errors**: Participant names, screen-shared content references, technical terms.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Proper noun accuracy (Zoom not zoom, Microsoft Teams not microsoft teams, Google Meet not google meet)
```

**Minimal (for live captions where brevity matters):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. MANDATORY: Professional vocabulary (agenda not agender, minutes not minuts, action item not action itam)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim for meeting records; minimal for live captions
- For live captions, speed matters more than capturing every "um"
- Allow users to add custom vocabulary for their organization

### Medical platforms

**Use case**: Clinical documentation, patient encounters, telehealth, medical dictation.

**Recommended prompt (patient conversations - full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Pharmaceutical accuracy required (omeprazole not omeprizole, metformin not metforman)
```

**For clinical dictation (polished output):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. MANDATORY: Publication-quality drug names (acetaminophen not acetaminophin, ibuprofen not ibuprofin)
```

**For specialty-specific:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. Strict requirement: Medical terminology accuracy (diagnosis not diagnosus, prescription not perscription, symptoms not simptoms)
```

**Common medical error patterns:**
- `-azole` endings: omeprazole, fluconazole, metronidazole
- `-statin` endings: atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin
- `-pril` endings: lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril
- Complex compounds: acetaminophen, hydrochlorothiazide

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim for patient conversations captures symptom descriptions: "It hurts, um, kind of here- no, more like here"
- Minimal for physician dictation where speech is already polished
- Drug name accuracy is critical for patient safety - vowel errors like "omeprizole" could cause dispensing errors
- The model generalizes from examples: showing vowel errors in common drugs fixes the pattern in ALL drugs

### Productivity software/tools

**Use case**: Voice notes, dictation, task capture, voice commands.

```

**For voice commands (minimal - precision over verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. MANDATORY: Action clarity (schedule not schedual, reminder not remindre, deadline not deadlin)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim for brainstorming voice notes: "I want to, um, maybe add a- no wait, let's do..." captures thought process
- Minimal for voice commands where you just need the action
- Add your integrated app names as examples

### Revenue/Sales intelligence and coaching

- Customer buying signals show in disfluencies - "We, um, we might be interested" (hesitation) vs "We're interested" (commitment)
- False starts reveal objections forming - "I don't- well, I mean, the budget is..."
- Replace company name examples with your actual competitors

### Avatar/dubbing

**Use case**: Voice synthesis input, dubbing preparation, lip-sync content.

**Common errors**: Timing-critical - need accurate word boundaries; pronunciation preservation.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim - required for lip-sync):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Preserve exact speech patterns. No smoothing or corrections.
```

**For dubbing prep:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)

```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim is mandatory - every "um" and pause affects lip-sync timing
- Colloquial forms matter for mouth shapes: "gonna" (2 syllables) vs "going to" (3 syllables) changes lip movement
- False starts and stutters: "I th-thought" must be preserved exactly for natural dubbing
- Word-level timestamps are critical - verify alignment

### Podcast recording and editing

**Use case**: Episode transcription, show notes, searchable archives, audiograms.

- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Proper noun accuracy (Spotify not spot-ify, Patreon not patron, YouTube not you tube)
```

**Tips:**

- Disfluencies show authentic conversation vs scripted - "I, I actually think..." sounds more genuine
- Replace platform examples with your show name, guest names, and sponsor names

### Video editing

**Use case**: Subtitle generation, content editing, searchable video archives.

- Speaker diarization complements transcription - use both features

### Legal tech and e-discovery platforms

**Common legal error patterns:**
- Latin terms: habeas corpus, pro bono, ex parte, voir dire
- Process terms: deposition, adjudication, litigation, arbitration
- Document types: affidavit, subpoena, injunction, stipulation

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim is legally required - "I, uh, don't recall" vs "I don't recall" have different evidentiary weight
- Hesitation captured: "Did you see the defendant?" "I... I think so" vs "I think so" - the pause matters
- False starts show witness uncertainty: "He was- I mean, she was there"
- Party names and case numbers require post-processing validation

### Market intelligence research

- Strict requirement: Industry term accuracy (demographic not demograhic, analytics not analitics, segmentation not segmantation)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim reveals true consumer sentiment - "I, um, I guess I like it" (lukewarm) vs "I like it" (appears positive)
- Hesitation before brand mentions: "I usually buy... um... Nike" suggests weak brand loyalty
- False starts show conflicting opinions: "I love- well, I don't love it, but..."
- Replace brand examples with the specific brands you're researching
