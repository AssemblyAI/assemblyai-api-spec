Universal-3-Pro is the first production-quality speech model that adapts its behavior based on the instructions you provide.Describe your audio in plain language and the model adjusts its transcription accordingly.

## Overview

Natural Language prompting allows you to provide up to 1,500 words of contextual information using the `prompt` parameter to help the model better interpret ambiguous speech, technical terminology, and domain-specific language.

Without Prompting:

```txt wordWrap
I just want to move you along a bit further. Do you take any prescribed medicines? I know you've got diabetes and high blood pressure. I do. I take Ramipril. Okay. And I take Metformin, and there's another one that begins with G for the diabetes. Glicoside. Excellent. Okay. And do you know the dosage of the Ramipril? I think it's 5mg. 5mg, and do you take it regularly? Oh yeah, yeah. Good. Every evening. And no side effects with it? I did have an awful cough to start with, but that's stopped now. It's settled, good. Okay, and do you know the metformin, do you take it, do you know the dosage and how often? I take it 3 times a day, but I don't know what dose that is. Okay, we can check that out, we can follow that up, okay.
```

With prompting, you can preserve natural speech elements like filler words and stutters while correcting specialized terms. For instance, adding 'clinical history evaluation' as context corrects 'Glicoside' to 'Glycoside'.

I just wanna move you along a bit further. Do you take any prescribed medicines? I know you've got diabetes and high blood pressure. I, I do. I take, um, I take Ramipril. Okay, mhm. And I take Metformin, and there's another one that begins with G for the diabetes. So glycosi— glycosi— glycoside. Excellent. Okay, and do you know the dosage of the Ramipril? Uh, I think it's 5mg. 5mg. And do you take it regularly? Oh yeah, yeah. Good. Every evening. And no side effects with it? Um, I did have an awful cough to start with, but that's, that's stopped now. It's settled, good. Okay, and do you know, erm, the metformin? Do you take it, do you know the dosage and how often? I take it 3 times a day, but I don't know what dose that is. Okay, we can check that out, we can follow that up, okay.

## Prompt generator

This prompt generator helps you create a starting prompt based on your selected transcription style. Paste a sample of your transcript and select your preferred style to get a customized prompt recommendation from your preferred LLM. Note LLMs will still be learning to index this content, so you may need to experiment some to get the best output.
