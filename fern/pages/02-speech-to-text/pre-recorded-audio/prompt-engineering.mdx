title: "Customizing transcription results using Prompt Engineering"
---

Use prompt engineering to control transcription style, from ultra-clean readable output to highly verbose verbatim transcriptions that capture every disfluency and false start. Different prompt formulations can dramatically affect transcription output.

## Overview

The `prompt` parameter allows you to influence how the model transcribes your audio. By providing natural language instructions, you can guide the model to produce transcripts that match your specific needs, whether that's capturing every hesitation for research purposes or creating clean, readable text for publication.

## Baseline: Universal-3 Pro without prompt

Universal-3 Pro without any prompt produces clean, readable transcription with proper capitalization and minimal disfluencies. This serves as the baseline for comparing prompt effects.

**Baseline characteristics:**
- **Word count:** 4,418 words
- No filler words ("um", "uh") in default mode
- Proper capitalization of entities and terms
- Clean sentence structure with appropriate punctuation

## Prompt summary

The following table summarizes how different prompts affect word count compared to baseline (4,418 words):

| Prompt type | Prompt | Words vs baseline |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Entity-Focused | `This is a virtual business meeting, transcribe verbatim and pay close attention to entities like names, company names, products, due dates, release dates, etc. Do not make any insertions/hallucinations of phrases, just edits for missing or wrong words.` | +72 (+1.6%) |
| Basic Disfluencies | `This is a virtual business meeting. Transcribe the audio verbatim, including all disfluencies and false starts.` | +280 (+6.3%) |
| Enhanced Disfluencies | `This is a virtual business meeting. Transcribe the audio verbatim, overly trying to capture hesitations, disfluencies, and false starts. This should be as close to a human transcriptionist as possible.` | +291 (+6.6%) |
| Maximum Verbatim | `Transcribe the audio verbatim, overly trying to capture hesitations, disfluencies, and false starts. This should be as close to a human transcriptionist as possible. We want all um, uhs, you know, start stop, hesitation, stud-stud-studder, etc.` | +349 (+7.9%) |
| Clean and Readable | `This is a business meeting. We don't want lots of disfluencies and false starts. Focus on making the transcript super readable and more about meaning and sentence structure and punctuation versus verbatim.` | +111 (+2.5%) |

## Prompt examples

### Entity-focused transcription

Use this prompt when accurate capture of business entities is critical.

```text
This is a virtual business meeting, transcribe verbatim and pay close attention
to entities like names, company names, products, due dates, release dates, etc.
Do not make any insertions/hallucinations of phrases, just edits for missing or
wrong words.
```

This prompt produces output with improved capitalization of proper nouns and entities. It's ideal for business meeting minutes, earnings calls, product launches, and any context where entity accuracy is critical.

**Result:** 4,490 words (+72 words, +1.6% vs baseline)

### Basic disfluency capture

Use this prompt when you need to capture conversational disfluencies while maintaining readability.

```text
This is a virtual business meeting. Transcribe the audio verbatim, including all
disfluencies and false starts.
```

This prompt adds filler words like "um" and "uh" to the output and captures false starts with em-dashes. It's useful for qualitative research interviews, therapy sessions, linguistic analysis, and training data for conversation AI.

**Result:** 4,698 words (+280 words, +6.3% vs baseline)

### Enhanced disfluency capture

Use this prompt for more aggressive disfluency capture with explicit emphasis.

```text
This is a virtual business meeting. Transcribe the audio verbatim, overly trying
to capture hesitations, disfluencies, and false starts. This should be as close
to a human transcriptionist as possible.
```

Using intensifying language like "overly trying" and comparing to a human transcriptionist increases capture rates. This is useful for forensic analysis, legal depositions, and detailed conversation analysis.

### Maximum verbatim with examples

Use this prompt when you need the highest fidelity transcription with all speech patterns captured.

```text
Transcribe the audio verbatim, overly trying to capture hesitations, disfluencies,
and false starts. This should be as close to a human transcriptionist as possible.
We want all um, uhs, you know, start stop, hesitation, stud-stud-studder, etc.
```

Providing concrete examples of disfluencies to capture produces the highest word count and captures repeated hesitations. This is ideal for speech pathology research, communication pattern analysis, and training data for natural TTS systems.

## Recommended prompts by use case

### Business and corporate

**Meeting minutes:**
```text
This is a business meeting. Focus on making the transcript readable and
professional. Capture key entities like names, dates, and action items
accurately. Remove most filler words but keep the natural flow.
```

**Earnings calls:**
```text
This is a corporate earnings call. Transcribe verbatim with attention to
financial terms, company names, metrics, and forward-looking statements.
Maintain professional readability.
```

### Research and analysis

**Qualitative research:**
```text
This is a research interview. Transcribe the audio verbatim, including
disfluencies and false starts. Capture um, uh, you know, and hesitations
to preserve natural speech patterns for analysis.
```

**Linguistic analysis:**
```text
Transcribe the audio verbatim, overly trying to capture all hesitations,
disfluencies, false starts, repairs, and stutters. We want every um, uh,
like, you know, and incomplete word or phrase.
```

### Legal and compliance

**Legal depositions:**
```text
This is a legal deposition. Transcribe verbatim, capturing every word,
hesitation, pause indication, and false start exactly as spoken. Maximum
accuracy and completeness required.
```

**Compliance recording:**
```text
This is a compliance-monitored call. Transcribe verbatim while maintaining
clarity. Capture all substantive statements accurately, including corrections
and clarifications made by speakers.
```

### Media and content

**Podcast and video transcripts:**
```text
This is a podcast/video. Create a readable transcript that maintains the
conversational tone but removes excessive filler words. Keep false starts
and corrections that add character.
```

**Subtitles and captions:**
```text
This is video content for captions. Focus on readability and timing.
Remove most disfluencies but keep natural speech rhythm. Use clear
punctuation and sentence structure.
```

### Medical and clinical

**Therapy sessions:**
```text
This is a therapy session. Transcribe verbatim including all hesitations,
pauses, false starts, and emotional indicators. Capture um, uh, and other
speech patterns that may be clinically relevant.
```

**Medical consultations:**
```text
This is a doctor-patient consultation. Transcribe verbatim with careful
attention to medical terminology, symptoms, medications, and dosages.
Maintain clarity while preserving exact patient statements.
```

## Best practices

When crafting prompts for transcription, keep these principles in mind:

**Prompt specificity matters.** The progression from general instructions like "including all disfluencies" to specific examples like "um, uhs, you know, stud-stud-studder" shows consistent increases in disfluency capture. Provide concrete examples of what you want captured.

**Bidirectional control is possible.** You can effectively move in both directions: more verbose with maximum verbatim prompts or less verbose with clean readable prompts. Use opposite-direction prompts to achieve your desired style.

**Language intensity works.** Using intensifying language like "overly trying" and "as close to a human transcriptionist as possible" demonstrably increases capture rates.

**Examples drive behavior.** The biggest improvements come from adding concrete examples of disfluencies to capture. Include 3-5 specific examples of the speech patterns you want captured or avoided.

## API usage

Use the `prompt` parameter when submitting a transcription request:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <Tab language="python" title="Python" default>
    ```python
    import requests
    import time

    base_url = "https://api.assemblyai.com"
    headers = {"authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"}

    data = {
        "audio_url": "https://example.com/your-audio.mp3",
        "prompt": "This is a business meeting. Focus on making the transcript readable and professional."
    }

    response = requests.post(base_url + "/v2/transcript", headers=headers, json=data)

    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, Response: {response.text}")
        response.raise_for_status()

    transcript_response = response.json()
    transcript_id = transcript_response["id"]
    polling_endpoint = f"{base_url}/v2/transcript/{transcript_id}"

    while True:
        transcript = requests.get(polling_endpoint, headers=headers).json()
        if transcript["status"] == "completed":
            print(transcript["text"])
            break
        elif transcript["status"] == "error":
            raise RuntimeError(f"Transcription failed: {transcript['error']}")
        else:
            time.sleep(3)
    ```

      }

      const data = {
        audio_url: 'https://example.com/your-audio.mp3',
        prompt: 'This is a business meeting. Focus on making the transcript readable and professional.'
      }

      const url = `${baseUrl}/v2/transcript`
      const response = await axios.post(url, data, { headers: headers })

      const transcriptId = response.data.id
      const pollingEndpoint = `${baseUrl}/v2/transcript/${transcriptId}`

      while (true) {
        const pollingResponse = await axios.get(pollingEndpoint, {

        })
        const transcriptionResult = pollingResponse.data

        if (transcriptionResult.status === 'completed') {
          console.log(transcriptionResult.text)
          break
        } else if (transcriptionResult.status === 'error') {
          throw new Error(`Transcription failed: ${transcriptionResult.error}`)
        } else {
          await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000))
        }
      }
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Prompt guidelines

When using the `prompt` parameter, keep these guidelines in mind:

- **Character limit:** 1,000 characters recommended
- **Optimal length:** 100-200 characters for clear, focused instructions
- **Formatting:** Plain text, no special formatting required
