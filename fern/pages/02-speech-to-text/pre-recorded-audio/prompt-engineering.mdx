title: "Customizing transcription results using Prompt Engineering"
---

Use prompt engineering to control transcription style and improve accuracy for domain-specific terminology. This guide documents best practices for crafting effective prompts for Universal-3 Pro speech transcription, based on extensive testing (~1,000+ prompt variations).

The key finding: **showing the model examples of error patterns you want corrected teaches it to fix those patterns across all similar terms**.

## Core principles

### The winning formula

```text
[Base instruction] + [Pushy language] + [Specific concept] + [Concrete examples]
```

All four components matter, but examples are critical.

### Keep it concise

Limit prompts to 3-5 instructions maximum. Overly verbose prompts don't improve accuracy. Each instruction should be actionable and specific.

### Show, don't just tell

The model learns **error patterns** from examples, not just specific words. When you show:

```text
(omeprazole not omeprizole, metformin not metforman)
```

The model learns: "Fix vowel substitution errors in pharmaceutical terms" and applies this to ALL drugs, including ones not in your examples.

## Prompt components

### Base instructions

Choose based on your transcription needs:

| Style | Base instruction | Use when |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Minimal** | `Transcribe verbatim.` | Clean audio, formal speech |
| **With disfluencies** | `Transcribe verbatim:`<br/>`- Include all disfluencies` | Conversational audio, interviews |
| **Full disfluency** | See template below | Research, linguistic analysis |

**Full disfluency template:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
```

### Pushy language (required)

The model responds to authoritative, non-negotiable language. Use one of:

| Phrase | Effectiveness |
|--------|---------------|
| `Non-negotiable:` | High |
| `MANDATORY:` | High |
| `Strict requirement:` | High |
| `Must follow:` | Medium-High |
| `REQUIRED:` | Medium-High |
| `Essential:` | Medium |

### Context setting (optional, minor impact)

Context phrases like `Context: Medical transcription` provide marginal benefit at best. Testing showed:

- Winner with context: 100% success
- Winner without context: 90-100% success

**Examples do the heavy lifting.** Context is not a substitute for concrete examples. If you're limited on prompt length, prioritize examples over context.

```text
Context: [Domain description].
```

### Role priming (optional, minor impact)

Role phrases may help slightly but are not required:

- `As pharmacist reviewer:`
- `For legal review:`

## The critical component: Examples

### Why examples work

The model learns **error patterns** from examples, not just specific words. When you show:

```text
(omeprazole not omeprizole, metformin not metforman)
```

The model learns: "Fix vowel substitution errors in pharmaceutical terms" and applies this to ALL drugs, including ones not in your examples.

### How to construct examples

1. **Identify the error pattern** in your domain (vowel swaps, similar-sounding words, etc.)
2. **Choose 2-3 common terms** where this error frequently occurs
3. **Show correct to incorrect** format: `(correct not incorrect)`

### Example patterns by error type

| Error type | Example format |
|------------|----------------|
| Vowel substitution | `(omeprazole not omeprizole)` |
| Sound-alike confusion | `(CABG not cabbage)` |
| Phonetic spelling | `(prescription not perscription)` |
| Technical terms | `(kubernetes not kubernetties)` |
| Proper nouns | `(Salesforce not sales force)` |

## What doesn't work

Based on testing, avoid these patterns:

### Vague instructions without examples

```text
Use correct medical terminology.
Transcribe accurately.
Be precise with drug names.
```

*Why it fails: No error pattern for the model to learn from*

### Overly long prompts (>500 chars)

```text
You are a medical transcriptionist with 20 years of experience.
Your job is to accurately transcribe medical dictation...
[continues for 10 more lines]
```

*Why it fails: Signal gets lost in noise*

### Weak/polite language

```text
Please try to use correct spelling.
If possible, verify drug names.
It would be nice to have accurate terms.
```

*Why it fails: Model doesn't prioritize non-authoritative requests*

### Examples of what you DON'T want only

```text
Don't write "omeprizole" or "metforman"
```

*Why it fails: Needs the correct form, not just the incorrect one*

## Quick reference: Building your prompt

### Step 1: Choose your base

- Clean audio: `Transcribe verbatim.`
- Conversational: `Transcribe verbatim:\n- Include all disfluencies`

### Step 2: Add pushy language (required)

- `Non-negotiable:` / `MANDATORY:` / `Strict requirement:`

### Step 3: State the specific requirement

- `Pharmaceutical accuracy required`
- `Legal terminology accuracy`
- `Technical term precision`

### Step 4: Add 2-3 examples (critical)

- `(correct not incorrect, correct2 not incorrect2)`

### Step 5: Add context (optional, minor impact)

- `Context: [Your domain].`

### Final format

```text
[Base]. [Pushy language]: [Requirement] ([example1 not wrong1], [example2 not wrong2])
```

## Testing your prompts

### Recommended approach

1. **Identify your target terms** - What specific words/phrases are being transcribed incorrectly?
2. **Find the error pattern** - Is it vowel substitution? Sound-alike confusion? Phonetic spelling?
3. **Choose example terms** - Pick 2-3 common terms with the SAME error pattern (not the exact terms you're trying to fix)
4. **Test 5-10 times** - Due to model variability, test multiple times to measure true accuracy
5. **Measure success rate** - Aim for 90%+ accuracy on target terms

### Success metrics

- **90-100%**: Production ready
- **70-89%**: May need example refinement
- **Less than 70%**: Revisit error pattern analysis

## Prompt engineering walkthrough: Virtual meeting

This walkthrough demonstrates how different prompts affect transcription output using a real virtual business meeting recording. The baseline is Universal-3 Pro without any prompt, which produces clean, readable transcription with 4,418 words.

### Baseline vs prompted comparison

The following examples show how prompts can increase or decrease verbosity compared to the baseline. Each example uses the same audio file to demonstrate the effect of different prompt formulations.

**Source audio:** Virtual business meeting (team staff meeting)

| Prompt type | Words | Change vs baseline |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| Baseline (no prompt) | 4,418 | — |
| Maximum verbatim | 4,767 | +349 (+7.9%) |
| Enhanced disfluencies | 4,709 | +291 (+6.6%) |
| Basic disfluencies | 4,698 | +280 (+6.3%) |
| Clean and readable | 4,529 | +111 (+2.5%) |

### Maximum verbatim prompt

Use this prompt when you need the highest fidelity transcription with all speech patterns captured.

```text
Transcribe the audio verbatim, overly trying to capture hesitations, disfluencies,
and false starts. This should be as close to a human transcriptionist as possible.
We want all um, uhs, you know, start stop, hesitation, stud-stud-studder, etc.
```

Providing concrete examples of disfluencies to capture produces the highest word count and captures repeated hesitations. This is ideal for speech pathology research, communication pattern analysis, and training data for natural TTS systems.

### Enhanced disfluency prompt

Use this prompt for aggressive disfluency capture with explicit emphasis.

```text
This is a virtual business meeting. Transcribe the audio verbatim, overly trying
to capture hesitations, disfluencies, and false starts. This should be as close
to a human transcriptionist as possible.
```

Using intensifying language like "overly trying" and comparing to a human transcriptionist increases capture rates. This is useful for forensic analysis, legal depositions, and detailed conversation analysis.

### Basic disfluency prompt

Use this prompt when you need to capture conversational disfluencies while maintaining readability.

```text
This is a virtual business meeting. Transcribe the audio verbatim, including all
disfluencies and false starts.
```

This prompt adds filler words like "um" and "uh" to the output and captures false starts with em-dashes. It's useful for qualitative research interviews, therapy sessions, linguistic analysis, and training data for conversation AI.

### Key observations

The walkthrough demonstrates several important patterns:

1. **Concrete examples drive behavior** - The maximum verbatim prompt includes specific examples like "um, uhs, you know, stud-stud-studder" which produces the highest disfluency capture rate.

2. **Intensifying language works** - Phrases like "overly trying" and "as close to a human transcriptionist as possible" measurably increase capture rates.

3. **Bidirectional control** - You can move in both directions: more verbose with disfluency prompts or cleaner with readability-focused prompts.

4. **Consistent patterns** - The same audio produces consistently different outputs based on prompt formulation, demonstrating reliable prompt engineering effects.

## Use case templates

The following templates are optimized for specific industries and applications. Each includes recommended prompts and common error patterns to address.

### AI-powered meeting intelligence

**Use case**: Transcribing business meetings for summaries, action items, and searchable archives.

**Common errors**: Company names, product names, project codenames, attendee names, acronyms.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Proper noun accuracy (Salesforce not sales force, Asana not a sauna, Figma not fig ma)
```

**Minimal (for polished summaries only):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. Non-negotiable: Product and company name accuracy (Kubernetes not kubernetties, Elasticsearch not elastic search, MongoDB not mongo DB)
```

**Tips:**
- Use full verbatim for raw transcripts; minimal for auto-summarization pipelines
- Add your specific company/product names as examples if they're commonly misheard
- For recurring meetings, identify which terms get mangled and add those as examples

### Call centers and contact centers

**Use case**: Customer service calls, support tickets, quality assurance, compliance monitoring.

**Common errors**: Product names, policy terms, ticket/case numbers, customer account references.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim - required for compliance):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Policy term accuracy (warranty not warrenty, reimbursement not reimbersment, eligibility not eligability)
```

**For compliance-focused transcription:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Customer service accuracy (cancellation not cancelation, subscription not subsciption, representative not representive)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim is critical for compliance - captures exact phrasing like "I, uh, I guess I agree" vs "I agree"
- Disfluencies reveal customer confusion (false starts), frustration (repetitions), hesitation (fillers)
- Replace examples with your product-specific terms that get misheard

### Call tracking

**Use case**: Marketing attribution, lead tracking, campaign performance analysis.

**Common errors**: Campaign names, promo codes, URL mentions, phone numbers spoken aloud.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Marketing term accuracy (referral not referal, campaign not campain, promotional not promotial)
```

**Minimal (for analytics pipelines):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. Strict requirement: Alphanumeric accuracy for codes and references. Marketing terminology (coupon not cupon, discount not disount)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim captures caller intent signals (hesitation before providing info)
- If tracking specific campaign names, add them as examples
- Promo codes are challenging - consider post-processing validation

### Conversation intelligence as a service

**Use case**: B2B analytics platform processing diverse customer audio.

**Common errors**: Varies by customer domain - need flexible, generalizable prompts.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim - default for conversation analysis):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Business terminology accuracy (revenue not revenu, acquisition not aqusition, quarterly not quartly)
```

**Minimal (for downstream NLP that strips disfluencies anyway):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. Non-negotiable: Professional vocabulary accuracy (strategy not stragety, implementation not implimentation, infrastructure not infastructure)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim is essential for sentiment analysis, talk-time ratios, interruption detection
- Allow customers to specify their own example terms via API
- Build a library of domain-specific example sets customers can choose from

### CRMs

**Use case**: Sales call logging, contact records, deal notes, activity capture.

**Common errors**: Company names, contact names, deal values, competitor mentions.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Company and contact name accuracy. Business term precision (proposal not propsal, contract not contrakt, negotiation not negotation)
```

**Minimal (for auto-logging summaries):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. MANDATORY: Sales vocabulary accuracy (procurement not procurment, stakeholder not stakholdr, decision-maker not decision maker)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim captures prospect hesitation and buying signals
- Integrate with CRM data to validate company/contact names post-transcription
- Competitor names are high-value - add common competitors as examples

### EdTech

**Use case**: Lecture transcription, tutoring sessions, educational content, accessibility.

**Common errors**: Academic terminology, subject-specific vocabulary, citation references.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim - for tutoring/interactive sessions):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Academic terminology accuracy (curriculum not curiculum, pedagogy not pedogogy, assessment not assesment)
```

**For STEM lectures (polished output):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. Strict requirement: Scientific term accuracy (algorithm not algorythm, hypothesis not hypothesus, variable not varable)
```

**For humanities:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. MANDATORY: Academic vocabulary (bibliography not bibilography, dissertation not disertation, methodology not methodolgy)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim for tutoring captures student thinking process and confusion points
- Minimal works for polished lecture recordings meant for captions
- For language learning content, disfluencies are pedagogically valuable - use full verbatim
- Different subjects have different terminology - customize examples per course/subject

### Hiring platforms

**Use case**: Interview transcription, candidate screening, hiring analytics.

**Common errors**: Job titles, company names, technical skills, certifications.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim - critical for interview analysis):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Professional terminology accuracy (LinkedIn not linked in, resume not resumay, candidate not canadate)
```

**For technical roles:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Technical skill accuracy (JavaScript not java script, PostgreSQL not post-gress, Kubernetes not kubernetties)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim is essential - hesitations, self-corrections, and false starts reveal candidate thinking patterns
- Stutters on technical questions vs fluent answers are meaningful signals
- Add role-specific technical terms as examples based on job requirements

### Online meeting platforms

**Use case**: General video conferencing transcription, closed captions, meeting records.

**Common errors**: Participant names, screen-shared content references, technical terms.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Proper noun accuracy (Zoom not zoom, Microsoft Teams not microsoft teams, Google Meet not google meet)
```

**Minimal (for live captions where brevity matters):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. MANDATORY: Professional vocabulary (agenda not agender, minutes not minuts, action item not action itam)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim for meeting records; minimal for live captions
- For live captions, speed matters more than capturing every "um"
- Allow users to add custom vocabulary for their organization

### Revenue/sales intelligence and sales coaching

**Use case**: Sales call analysis, coaching insights, deal intelligence, competitive intel.

**Common errors**: Competitor names, pricing terms, objection handling phrases, sales methodology terms.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim - essential for coaching):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Sales terminology accuracy (procurement not procurment, revenue not revenu, quarterly not quartly)
```

**For methodology-specific coaching:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Business vocabulary accuracy (stakeholder not stakholder, implementation not implimentation, integration not intergration)
```

**For competitive intelligence:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Strict requirement: Company name accuracy (Salesforce not sales force, HubSpot not hub spot, Atlassian not atlassion)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim captures coaching moments - confident rep: "The price is fifty thousand" vs hesitant rep: "The, uh, the price is... fifty thousand"
- Customer buying signals show in disfluencies - "We, um, we might be interested" (hesitation) vs "We're interested" (commitment)
- False starts reveal objections forming - "I don't- well, I mean, the budget is..."
- Replace company name examples with your actual competitors

### Medical platforms

**Use case**: Clinical documentation, patient encounters, telehealth, medical dictation.

**Tested extensively - 90-100% accuracy achievable.**

**Recommended prompt (patient conversations - full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Pharmaceutical accuracy required (omeprazole not omeprizole, metformin not metforman)
```

**For clinical dictation (polished output):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. MANDATORY: Publication-quality drug names (acetaminophen not acetaminophin, ibuprofen not ibuprofin)
```

**For specialty-specific:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. Strict requirement: Medical terminology accuracy (diagnosis not diagnosus, prescription not perscription, symptoms not simptoms)
```

**Common medical error patterns:**
- `-azole` endings: omeprazole, fluconazole, metronidazole
- `-statin` endings: atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin
- `-pril` endings: lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril
- Complex compounds: acetaminophen, hydrochlorothiazide

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim for patient conversations captures symptom descriptions: "It hurts, um, kind of here- no, more like here"
- Minimal for physician dictation where speech is already polished
- Drug name accuracy is critical for patient safety - vowel errors like "omeprizole" could cause dispensing errors
- The model generalizes from examples: showing vowel errors in common drugs fixes the pattern in ALL drugs

### Productivity software/tools

**Use case**: Voice notes, dictation, task capture, voice commands.

**Common errors**: App names, action verbs, proper nouns.

**Recommended prompt (voice notes - full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Application name accuracy (Notion not no shun, Todoist not to do ist, Trello not trel oh)
```

**For voice commands (minimal - precision over verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim. MANDATORY: Action clarity (schedule not schedual, reminder not remindre, deadline not deadlin)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim for brainstorming voice notes: "I want to, um, maybe add a- no wait, let's do..." captures thought process
- Minimal for voice commands where you just need the action
- Add your integrated app names as examples

### Avatar/dubbing

**Use case**: Voice synthesis input, dubbing preparation, lip-sync content.

**Common errors**: Timing-critical - need accurate word boundaries; pronunciation preservation.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim - required for lip-sync):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Preserve exact speech patterns. No smoothing or corrections.
```

**For dubbing prep:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Exact syllable preservation (going to not gonna, want to not wanna) for lip-sync accuracy
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim is mandatory - every "um" and pause affects lip-sync timing
- Colloquial forms matter for mouth shapes: "gonna" (2 syllables) vs "going to" (3 syllables) changes lip movement
- False starts and stutters: "I th-thought" must be preserved exactly for natural dubbing
- Word-level timestamps are critical - verify alignment

### Podcast recording and editing

**Use case**: Episode transcription, show notes, searchable archives, audiograms.

**Common errors**: Guest names, show names, sponsor names, niche topic vocabulary.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Media term accuracy (podcast not pod cast, episode not episod, subscriber not subscirber)
```

**For interview podcasts:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Proper noun accuracy (Spotify not spot-ify, Patreon not patron, YouTube not you tube)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim helps editors find cut points - natural pauses after "um" or false starts are good edit locations
- Disfluencies show authentic conversation vs scripted - "I, I actually think..." sounds more genuine
- Replace platform examples with your show name, guest names, and sponsor names

### Video editing

**Use case**: Subtitle generation, content editing, searchable video archives.

**Common errors**: Speaker names, on-screen text references, technical terms.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Video term accuracy (thumbnail not thumnail, subscribe not subscibe, notification not notifcation)
```

**For tutorial content:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Strict requirement: Technical term accuracy (tutorial not tutoreal, demonstration not demonstation, screenshot not screen shot)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim helps find edit points - cut after "um" or before false starts for clean edits
- Disfluencies in raw footage: "So, um, click here and then- actually, first go to..." shows where to trim
- Speaker diarization complements transcription - use both features

### Legal tech and e-discovery platforms

**Use case**: Depositions, court proceedings, legal document review, compliance.

**Common errors**: Legal terminology, party names, case citations, Latin phrases.

**Recommended prompt (depositions - full verbatim required):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Legal terminology accuracy (plaintiff not plantiff, defendant not defendent, subpoena not supena)
```

**For court proceedings:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Legal term precision (adjudicate not ajudicate, injunction not injuntion, testimony not testimoney)
```

**For contract review:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Strict requirement: Legal vocabulary (indemnification not indemnication, arbitration not arbritration, jurisdiction not juristiction)
```

**Common legal error patterns:**
- Latin terms: habeas corpus, pro bono, ex parte, voir dire
- Process terms: deposition, adjudication, litigation, arbitration
- Document types: affidavit, subpoena, injunction, stipulation

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim is legally required - "I, uh, don't recall" vs "I don't recall" have different evidentiary weight
- Hesitation captured: "Did you see the defendant?" "I... I think so" vs "I think so" - the pause matters
- False starts show witness uncertainty: "He was- I mean, she was there"
- Party names and case numbers require post-processing validation

### Market intelligence research

**Use case**: Focus groups, consumer interviews, competitive research, survey responses.

**Common errors**: Brand names, product names, competitor mentions, industry jargon.

**Recommended prompt (full verbatim - critical for sentiment):**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Non-negotiable: Consumer research accuracy (preference not preferance, recommendation not recomendation, satisfaction not satisfation)
```

**For focus groups:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- MANDATORY: Brand accuracy (Nike not nikey, Adidas not adeedas, Lululemon not lulu lemon)
```

**For competitive research:**

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was- I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
- Strict requirement: Industry term accuracy (demographic not demograhic, analytics not analitics, segmentation not segmantation)
```

**Tips:**
- Full verbatim reveals true consumer sentiment - "I, um, I guess I like it" (lukewarm) vs "I like it" (appears positive)
- Hesitation before brand mentions: "I usually buy... um... Nike" suggests weak brand loyalty
- False starts show conflicting opinions: "I love- well, I don't love it, but..."
- Replace brand examples with the specific brands you're researching

## Summary

| Principle | Implementation | Impact |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Concrete examples** | Show 2-3 examples of the error pattern being corrected | Critical |
| **Pushy language** | Use "Non-negotiable", "MANDATORY", "Strict requirement" | High |
| **Specific concept** | State exactly what accuracy you need | High |
| **Keep concise** | 3-5 instructions maximum | Medium |
| **Context** | Add domain context | Minor |

**The key insight**: Examples teach error patterns, not just specific corrections. Show the model what "wrong to right" looks like with common terms, and it will apply that pattern broadly across your domain.
