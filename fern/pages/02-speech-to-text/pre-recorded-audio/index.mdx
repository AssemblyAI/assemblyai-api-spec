Our Speech-to-Text model enables you to transcribe pre-recorded audio into written text.

On top of the transcription, you can enable other features and models, such as [Speaker Diarization](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization), by adding additional parameters to the same transcription request.

# API reference

You can find the API reference [here](/docs/api-reference/transcripts/submit).
