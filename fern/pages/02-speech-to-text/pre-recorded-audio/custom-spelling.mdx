Custom Spelling lets you customize how words are spelled or formatted in the transcript.


<Tabs groupId="language">
  <Tab language="python" title="Python" default>
To use Custom Spelling, pass a dictionary to `set_custom_spelling()` on the transcription config. Each key-value pair specifies a mapping from a word or phrase to a new spelling or format. The key specifies the new spelling or format, and the corresponding value is the word or phrase you want to replace.

```python {2-8}
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig()
config.set_custom_spelling(
  {
    "Gettleman": ["gettleman"],
    "SQL": ["Sequel"],
  }
)
transcriber = aai.Transcriber(config=config)
```

<Note>

The key is case-sensitive, but the value isn't. Additionally, the value can contain multiple words.

  <Tab language="typescript" title="TypeScript">
To use Custom Spelling, include `custom_spelling` in your transcription parameters. The parameter should be an array of objects, with each object specifying a mapping from a word or phrase to a new spelling or format.

```ts {3-12}
const params = {
  audio: audioUrl,
  custom_spelling: [
    {
      from: ['gettleman'],
      to: 'Gettleman'
    },
    {
      from: ['Sequel'],
      to: 'SQL'
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>

The value in the `to` key is case-sensitive, but the value in the `from` key isn't. Additionally, the `to` key must only contain one word, while the `from` key can contain multiple words.
