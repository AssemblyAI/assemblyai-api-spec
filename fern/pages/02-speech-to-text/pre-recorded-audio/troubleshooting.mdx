You can include words, phrases, or both in the `word_boost` parameter. Any term included has its likelihood of being transcribed boosted.

<Accordion title="Can I customize how words are spelled by the model?" theme="dark" iconColor="white" >
  
Yes. The Custom Spelling feature gives you the ability to specify how words are spelled or formatted in the transcript text. For example, Custom Spelling could be used to change the spelling of all instances of the word "Ariana" to "Arianna". It could also be used to change the formatting of "CS 50" to "CS50".

<Accordion title={`Why am I receiving a "400 Bad Request" error when making an API request?`} theme="dark" iconColor="white" >
  
A "400 Bad Request" error typically indicates that there's a problem with the formatting or content of the API request. Double-check the syntax of your request and ensure that all required parameters are included as described in the [API reference](https://assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/transcripts). If the issue persists, contact our support team for assistance.
