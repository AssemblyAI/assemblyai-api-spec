Semantic Kernel is an SDK for multiple programming languages to develop applications with [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/introduction-large-language-models-generative-ai/#what-are-language-models).
However, LLMs only operate on textual data and don't understand what is said in audio files.
With the [AssemblyAI integration for Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/AssemblyAI/assemblyai-semantic-kernel), you can use AssemblyAI's transcription models using the `TranscribePlugin` to transcribe your audio and video files.

## Quickstart

Add the [AssemblyAI.SemanticKernel NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AssemblyAI.SemanticKernel) to your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab  title="dotnet CLI">

```bash
dotnet add package AssemblyAI.SemanticKernel
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Package Manager Console">

```powershell
Install-Package AssemblyAI.SemanticKernel
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, register the `TranscriptPlugin` into your kernel:

<Code src="../../snippets/integrations/semantic-kernel/csharp-1.cs" />
## Usage

Get the `Transcribe` function from the transcript plugin and invoke it with the context variables.

<Code src="../../snippets/integrations/semantic-kernel/csharp-2.cs" />
You can get the transcript using `result.GetValue<string>()`.

You can also upload local audio and video file. To do this:

- Set the `TranscriptPlugin.AllowFileSystemAccess` property to `true`.
- Configure the `INPUT` variable with a local file path.

<Code src="../../snippets/integrations/semantic-kernel/csharp-3.cs" />
You can also invoke the function from within a semantic function like this.

<Code src="../../snippets/integrations/semantic-kernel/csharp-4.cs" />
