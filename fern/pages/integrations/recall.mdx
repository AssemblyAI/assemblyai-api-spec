title: "Build a Zoom Real-time transcription bot with Recall.ai"
---

A real-time transcription bot that integrates [Recall.ai](https://www.recall.ai/assemblyai) with [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com) to provide live transcription of Zoom meetings.

## Quickstart

<Code src="snippets/integrations/recall/bash-1.sh" />
## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) - [Installation guide](https://ngrok.com/download)
- Recall.ai API key with AssemblyAI configured

## Step-by-step

Follow this step-by-step guide to set up and run the transcription bot.

### Step 1: Get your API keys

**1.1 Choose your Recall.ai region and get your API Key:**

| Region           | Dashboard                                                    | RECALL_REGION    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| US Pay-as-you-go | [us-west-2.recall.ai](https://us-west-2.recall.ai)           | `us-west-2`      |
| US Monthly plan  | [us-east-1.recall.ai](https://us-east-1.recall.ai)           | `us-east-1`      |
| EU               | [eu-central-1.recall.ai](https://eu-central-1.recall.ai)     | `eu-central-1`   |
| Japan            | [ap-northeast-1.recall.ai](https://ap-northeast-1.recall.ai) | `ap-northeast-1` |

**1.2 Configure AssemblyAI in your Recall.ai dashboard:**

- Get an AssemblyAI API key from [assemblyai.com](https://www.assemblyai.com)
- In your Recall.ai dashboard (same region as step 1.1), navigate to the transcription providers section
- Add your AssemblyAI API key to enable AssemblyAI as a transcript provider

<Warning>
  This step is required for the bot to work with AssemblyAI transcription!
</Warning>

### Step 2: Clone the example repo and install dependencies

Open a new terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AssemblyAI/assemblyai-recallai-zoom-bot.git
cd assemblyai-recallai-zoom-bot
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure environment

Set up your environment variables using the example `.env` file in the repo:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Recall values.

```bash
RECALL_API_KEY=your_recall_api_key
RECALL_REGION=us-west-2
```

<Note>Set `RECALL_REGION` to according to your Recall region in Step 1.1</Note>

### Step 4: Start ngrok tunnel

In a new terminal, start ngrok to create a public URL for your webhook:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

The output should look like this:

```
ngrok by @inconshreveable

Session Status                online
Account                       your-account@email.com
Version                       2.3.40
Region                        United States (us)
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
Forwarding                    http://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
```

Copy the https URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`) - you'll need this for the next step.

### Step 5: Update Webhook URL

Edit your `.env` file and set `WEBHOOK_URL` to your ngrok URL:

```bash
WEBHOOK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

<Warning>Use the exact URL from ngrok output (no trailing slash)</Warning>

### Step 6: Start webhook server

In another terminal, start the webhook server (receives transcripts):

```bash
node webhook.js
```

### Step 7: Start the bot CLI

In another terminal, start the bot CLI (manages meeting connection):

```bash
node zoomBot.js
```

Once you run this command, you'll see this output:

```
[BOT] Starting Recall.ai bot for Zoom → AssemblyAI integration
[BOT] Configured for region: us-west-2
[BOT] API endpoint: https://us-west-2.recall.ai/api/v1
[BOT] Starting application...
[BOT] Validating configuration...
[BOT] ✓ Configuration valid
[BOT] ✓ Region: us-west-2
[BOT] ✓ Webhook: https://abc123.ngrok.io
[BOT] Ready to join meeting and start transcription
What is your meeting URL?:
```

### Step 8: Join meeting and start transcription

Enter your Zoom meeting URL when prompted:

```
What is your meeting URL?: https://zoom.us/j/123456789
```

And your terminal will look like this:

```
[BOT] Creating bot for meeting: https://zoom.us/j/123456789
[BOT] Webhook endpoint: https://abc123.ngrok.io/meeting_transcript
[API] POST /bot - Creating bot with AssemblyAI integration
[API] Bot created successfully
[BOT] Bot ID: bot_abc123
[BOT] Status: joining_call
[BOT] ✓ Bot deployed successfully
[BOT] Bot is joining meeting and will start sending transcripts to webhook
[BOT] Check Terminal 2 for real-time transcripts
Type "STOP" to end transcription:
```

In your second terminal (running `webhook.js`), you should see a meeting transcript of your participants:

```
[WEBHOOK] Server running on port 8000
[WEBHOOK] Ready to receive transcripts from Recall.ai
[WEBHOOK] Integration: Zoom → Recall.ai → AssemblyAI → This webhook
[TRANSCRIPT] PARTIAL - John Doe: Hello everyone
[TRANSCRIPT] PARTIAL - John Doe: Hello everyone, welcome to
[TRANSCRIPT] FINAL - John Doe: Hello everyone, welcome to today's meeting.
[TRANSCRIPT] FINAL - Jane Smith: Thanks for joining, let's get started with the agenda.
```

### Step 9: Stop transcription

To stop transcribing, type "STOP" to end transcription on your third terminal running `node zoomBot.js`:

```
Type "STOP" to end transcription: STOP
```

## Troubleshooting

### Environment Variable Errors

#### `RECALL_API_KEY not found in .env file`

Solution: Make sure you copied `.env.example` to `.env` and added your API key.

#### `RECALL_REGION must be one of: us-west-2, us-east-1, eu-central-1, ap-northeast-1`

Solution: Check your `.env` file and ensure `RECALL_REGION` matches where you got your API key

### Bot Creation Errors

#### AssemblyAI not configured

```bash
Failed to create bot: { recording_config: { transcript: { provider: [Object] } } }
```

Solution: Configure AssemblyAI in your Recall.ai dashboard (Step 1.2)

### Webhook Issues

#### No transcripts appearing

<Code src="snippets/integrations/recall/bash-2.sh" />
Solution:

- Verify `WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env` matches your ngrok URL exactly
- Ensure ngrok is still running (it may timeout after inactivity)
- Check that the webhook server was started before the bot

#### ngrok connection refused

```bash
Failed to complete tunnel connection
```

Solution:

- Restart ngrok: `ngrok http 8000`
- Update `WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env` with the new ngrok URL
- Ensure port 8000 is available

### Common network issues

#### Timeout connecting to Recall.ai

```bash
timeout of 10000ms exceeded
```

Solution:

- Check your internet connection
- Verify your `RECALL_REGION` is correct
- Try again after a few seconds

#### Bot appears to join but no transcripts

Solution:

- Ensure people are speaking in the meeting
- Check that meeting participants have unmuted their microphones
- Verify AssemblyAI is properly configured in Recall.ai dashboard
