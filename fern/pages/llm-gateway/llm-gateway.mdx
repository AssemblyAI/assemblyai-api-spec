## Overview

**AssemblyAI's LLM Gateway** is a unified interface that allows you to connect with multiple LLM providers including Claude, GPT, and Gemini. You can use the LLM Gateway to build sophisticated AI applications through a single API.

The LLM Gateway provides access to 15+ models across major AI providers with support for:

- **Basic Chat Completions** - Simple request/response interactions
- **Multi-turn Conversations** - Maintain context across multiple exchanges
- **Tool/Function Calling** - Enable models to execute custom functions
- **Agentic Workflows** - Multi-step reasoning with automatic tool chaining
- **Unified Interface** - One API for Claude, GPT, Gemini, and more

## Available models

Unsure which model to choose?

- Consider Claude models for nuanced reasoning and complex instructions
- Consider GPT models for code generation and structured outputs
- Consider Gemini models for cost-effective high-volume applications

<Note>
  Head to [our Playground](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/playground) to
  test out LLM Gateway without having to write any code!

## Select a model

You can specify which model to use in your request by setting the `model` parameter. Here are examples showing how to use Claude 4.5 Sonnet:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

```python {11}
import requests

headers = {
  "authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    headers = headers,
    json = {
        "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
        ],
        "max_tokens": 1000
    }
)

result = response.json()
print(result["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="JavaScript">

```javascript {10}
const response = await fetch(
  "https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1/chat/completions",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      authorization: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
      "content-type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is the capital of France?" }],
      max_tokens: 1000,
    }),
  }
);

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result.choices[0].message.content);
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Simply change the `model` parameter to use any of the available models listed in the [Available models](#available-models) section above.

  The LLM Gateway API is separate from the Speech-to-Text and Speech Understanding
  APIs. It provides a unified interface to work with large language models
  across multiple providers.
