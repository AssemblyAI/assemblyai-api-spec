# How long are outputs retained?

Outputs are retained indefinitely however customers also have control to delete files when they are no longer required for their intended purpose. Delete requests referencing transcript IDs can be submitted by customers using [the delete endpoint](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/transcripts/delete).

Starting on 11-26-2024, AssemblyAI will assign an account-level Time to Live (TTL) for customers who have executed a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with us. For those customers, all transcripts generated via the async transcription endpoint will be deleted after the TTL period (currently set to 3 days by default).
