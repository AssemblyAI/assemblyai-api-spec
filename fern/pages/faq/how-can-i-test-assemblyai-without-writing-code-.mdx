# How can I test AssemblyAI without writing code?

Start exploring our AI capabilities instantly using the [AssemblyAI Playground](https://www.assemblyai.com/playground). This tool lets you test transcription, summarization, topic detection, and content moderation by simply uploading an audio file to a web interface. Note that the Playground is a public demo tool with limited functionality, so avoid uploading sensitive data.

## Ready to build your app?

Create powerful AI applications without coding using AssemblyAI's integrations with popular no-code platforms like Zapier, [Make.com](http://Make.com), Power Automate, and Bubble. These platforms make it easy to build automated workflows and applications using our speech AI capabilities.
