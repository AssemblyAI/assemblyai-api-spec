title: "How does automatically scaling concurrency for Streaming STT work?"
---

Our Streaming STT feature includes automatically scaling concurrency limits.

We do not limit the total number of concurrent streaming sessions. Instead, there is only a limit on the number of **new streaming sessions** that can be created per minute.

Anytime you are using 70% or more of your current limit, your new sessions rate limit will automatically increase and scale up by 10% every 60 seconds.

As your traffic starts to scale back down and you are using less than 50% of your current limit, your new sessions rate limit will also start to scale back down until it eventually returns to your default value.

### What happens when I exceed my new streaming sessions per minute rate limit?

When you reach your streaming new sessions rate limit, new requests will receive a `1008` error with the message "`Unauthorized connection: Too many concurrent sessions`".
