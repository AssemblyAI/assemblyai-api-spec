title: "What languages are supported for Streaming Speech-to-text?"
---

## Current Supported Language

By default, Universal-Streaming is set to transcribe English audio.
If you'd like to enable multilingual streaming (support for English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese), enable [multilingual transcription (beta)](/docs/speech-to-text/universal-streaming/multilingual-transcription) instead.

## Difference from Async STT

It's important to note that the `language_code` parameter mentioned in some AssemblyAI documentation applies to the Async STT (Asynchronous Speech-to-Text) feature, not the Streaming Transcription feature. This can cause confusion when setting up the real-time transcriber. Because Streaming STT only supports English, there is no parameter for specifying a language.

## Future Language Support

AssemblyAI plans to add support Streaming Speech-to-text for additional languages in 2025. To stay informed about new features and improvements, including language support updates, you can follow our [Changelog](https://www.assemblyai.com/changelog).

<Note>
  If you require support for a specific language in Real-Time Transcription,
  please contact AssemblyAI's support team. They can pass your request to the
  Product team for consideration in future updates.
