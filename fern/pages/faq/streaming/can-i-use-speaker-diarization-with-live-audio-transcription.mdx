title: "Can I use speaker diarization with Streaming Speech-to-Text?"
---

Currently, speaker diarization is not available with our Streaming Speech-to-Text feature. However, there are alternative solutions you can consider for identifying speakers in live audio transcription scenarios.

## Alternative Solution for Speaker Identification in Live Audio

If your audio setup allows for each speaker to be recorded on a separate channel, you can implement the following workaround:

1. Open multiple streaming sessions - one for each audio channel.

2. Take the transcript text for each session and associate it with the appropriate speaker.

3. Combine the transcript text for the separate sessions into a single master transcript.

This method has proven effective for many users who need to identify speakers in real-time transcription scenarios.
