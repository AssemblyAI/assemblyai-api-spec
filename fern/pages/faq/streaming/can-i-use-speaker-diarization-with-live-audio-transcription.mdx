title: "Can I use speaker diarization with Streaming Speech-to-Text?"
---

Streaming diarization can be accomplished by using multichannel audio (i.e., an audio stream for each speaker). A separate session is created for each speaker and a single transcript is created from those sessions. Check out [this section](/docs/speech-to-text/universal-streaming/multichannel-streams) of our documentation to learn more about this approach.
