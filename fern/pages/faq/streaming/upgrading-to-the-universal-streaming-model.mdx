title: 'I am getting a "Model deprecated. See docs for new model information" error message. What does it mean?'
---

If you receive an error message indicating `Model deprecated, see our docs for new model information: https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-to-text/universal-streaming`, it means you are using an older version of our Streaming STT feature that is no longer supported.

## How to upgrade to the Universal-Streaming model

You'll need to update your implementation to use our new Universal Streaming model. Here's what to do:

1. Review the [Universal Streaming documentation](/docs/speech-to-text/universal-streaming) for detailed implementation guidance

2. For a quick start guide, see our [Getting Started with Streaming Audio](/docs/getting-started/transcribe-streaming-audio) documentation

<Note>
  The Universal Streaming model offers improved accuracy and reliability
  compared to our legacy streaming implementation.
