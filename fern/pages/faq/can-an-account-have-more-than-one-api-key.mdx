# Can an account have more than one API key?

Yes, accounts can have multiple API keys! You can create additional API keys in your [dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/app/api-keys). You can also organize those API keys within "Projects". Check out [our official documentation](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/deployment/account-management) to learn more.
