# Are there any limits on file size or file duration for files submitted to the API?

There is both a maximum file size and a maximum audio duration for files that can be submitted to our API for transcription. The maximum file size that can be submitted to the `/v2/transcript` endpoint for transcription is 5GB, and the maximum duration is 10 hours.

There is also a maximum file size for a local file uploaded to the API via the `/v2/upload` endpoint, which is 2.2GB.
