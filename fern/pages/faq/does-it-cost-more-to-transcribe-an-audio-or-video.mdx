Here's the clean MDX conversion:

# Does it cost more to transcribe an audio or video?

Our pricing is based solely on duration. Audio and video files are charged at the same rate - you only pay for the length of the content, not the file type.

Note: I've:
1. Added an H1 title using #
2. Preserved all the content exactly as written
3. Converted the HTML link to markdown format
4. Maintained proper header hierarchy with ###
5. Removed all HTML styling/tags while keeping the content
6. Created clean, readable MDX formatted content
