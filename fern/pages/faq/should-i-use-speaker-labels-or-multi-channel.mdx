# Should I use Speaker Labels or Multi-channel?

The choice depends on your audio source:

### Use Multi-channel when:

You have audio where each speaker is recorded on a separate channel, such as:

- Twilio calls with configured channel separation
- Call center software that exports multiple audio channels
- Any recording where speakers are pre-separated into channels

Multichannel is more accurate since each speaker's audio is processed independently.

> Note: Multichannel audio will not automatically separate multiple speakers on the same channel. If you have multiple speakers on a single channel, speaker labels are required for speaker separation.

### Use Speaker Labels when:

You have single-channel audio with multiple speakers, such as:

- Standard audio recordings with multiple participants
- Calls recorded as a single track
- Any audio where speakers share the same channel

For speaker labels, you can improve accuracy by specifying the expected number of speakers in advance [using the `speakers_expected` parameter](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/transcripts/submit#request.body.speakers_expected).
