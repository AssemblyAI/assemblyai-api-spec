# How does automatically scaling concurrency for Streaming STT work?

Our Streaming STT feature includes automatically scaling concurrency limits.

Anytime you are using 70% or more of your current limit, your concurrency limit will automatically increase and scale up by 10% every 60 seconds.

As your traffic starts to scale back down and you are using less than 50% of your current limit, your concurrency will start to scale back down until it eventually returns to your default value.

### What happens when I exceed my concurrency limit?

When you reach your streaming concurrency limit, new requests will receive a `1008` error with the message "`Unauthorized connection: Too many concurrent sessions`".
