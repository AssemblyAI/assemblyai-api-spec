# Do you offer servers in the EU?

Yes, we have endpoints in AWS EU West 1 (Dublin). All services except for Streaming can be handled completely in the EU.

If your use-case requires EU Data Residency, you can enable this by using the base URL of `api.eu.assemblyai.com`. See [this section](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/select-the-region) of our documentation for code examples showing how to change the base URL.

Check out [this cookbook](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides/how_to_use_the_eu_endpoint) for specific code examples showing how to change the base URL with our different SDKs.
