# What languages are supported for Streaming Speech-to-text?

## Current Supported Language

AssemblyAI's Streaming Speech-to-Text is only available in English.

## Difference from Async STT

It's important to note that the `language_code` parameter mentioned in some AssemblyAI documentation applies to the Async STT (Asynchronous Speech-to-Text) feature, not the Streaming Transcription feature. This can cause confusion when setting up the real-time transcriber. Because Streaming STT only supports English, there is no parameter for specifying a language.

## Future Language Support

AssemblyAI plans to add support Streaming Speech-to-text for additional languages in 2025. To stay informed about new features and improvements, including language support updates, you can follow our [Changelog](https://www.assemblyai.com/changelog).
