# How does AssemblyAI segment its environment?

AssemblyAI uses firewalls, VPCs, security groups, and IAM roles to segment its networks. Production environments have service IAM roles that can deploy into production and a limited group of administrators that can access the entirety of production.

Customers are segmented at the database - customers are only able to access information that corresponds to their API key.
