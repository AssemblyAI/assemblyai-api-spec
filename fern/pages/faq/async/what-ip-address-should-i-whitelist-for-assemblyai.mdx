title: "What IP Address Should I Whitelist for AssemblyAI?"
---

AssemblyAI sends all webhook deliveries from fixed IP addresses:

| Region | IP Address   |
| ------ | ------------ |
| US     | 44.238.19.20 |
| EU     | 54.220.25.36 |

When retrieving audio files submitted by your account, our systems use dynamic IP addresses by default. If your network security requirements require a static IP address for these retrieval requests, please [contact us](https://assembly.ai/support) to enable this feature for your account.
