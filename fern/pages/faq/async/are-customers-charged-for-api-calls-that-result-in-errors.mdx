title: "Do I Get Charged for Failed API Calls?"
---

You won't be charged for failed API calls. If your transcript response returns an "error" status, the request won't count against your credits.

You can review any failed transcripts in your [Async Transcription Processing Queue](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/transcription-history).
