title: "Do you offer translation?"
---

AssemblyAI does not currently offer translation services. Our API focuses on transcribing speech to text in the original spoken language.

While we don't provide direct translation, you can find examples of how to translate your transcripts using popular translation services in our Cookbooks. These guides demonstrate post-processing workflows using various commercial and open-source machine translation models.

**Cookbooks:**

- [Translating an AssemblyAI Subtitle Transcript](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides/translate_subtitles)
