Yes, we have a Make integration which you can find here: [https://www.make.com/en/integrations/assembly-ai](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/assembly-ai)

Make is a no-code platform that enables users to build their own workflows through their drag-and-drop features. Users can automate tasks involving voice and text data processing using AssemblyAI on the Make platform without needing to invest in custom software development.

You can also build an application that connects to various other platforms such as Gmail, Slack, Stripe, etc. For example, an audio file is transcribed by AssemblyAI, and the transcription results are then uploaded to a Google Drive.

The following modules are supported:

- Upload a File
- Transcripts
- Transcribe an Audio File (submit or poll)
