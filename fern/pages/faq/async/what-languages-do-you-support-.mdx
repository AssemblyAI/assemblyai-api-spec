title: "What languages do you support?"
---

This page shows which languages are supported by the AssemblyAI Async API, their `language_code` values, and the features available for that language.

AssemblyAI offers two different speech-to-text models: **Slam-1** and **Universal**.

Below, you'll find the supported languages for each model, as well as instructions on how to change the language for your transcription.

## Specify the language

You can use the optional `language_code` parameter to specify the language of the spoken audio in the files that you submit to the API. If you don't include a `language_code` parameter in your request, it defaults to `en_us`.

To learn more about using the `language_code` parameter, see [Set language manually](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/set-language-manually).

<Note>
  If you're unsure of the spoken language spoken in your audio file, you can use
  our [Automatic Language
  Detection](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/automatic-language-detection)
  feature to automatically identify the dominant language in your file.
</Note>

## Specify the speech model

You can use the optional `speech_model` parameter to specify the model. To learn more, see [Select the speech model](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/select-the-speech-model).

<Note>
The information on this page is specific to our Async Speech-to-Text feature for pre-recorded audio.

Our Streaming Speech-to-Text feature only supports English so there is no option to specify a language with that feature.
