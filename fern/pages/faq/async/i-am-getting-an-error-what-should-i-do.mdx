title: "What should I do if I'm getting an error?"
---

Any time you make a request to the API, you should receive a JSON response. If you don't receive the expected output, the JSON contains an `error` key with a message value describing the error.

To retrieve the error from our API:

1. Make a GET request to fetch the transcript details:

```
curl https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript/<transcript_id> \
     -H "Authorization: <apiKey>"
```

The response will include an `error` key with details about what went wrong:

```
{
    "status": "error",
    "error": "Download error, unable to access file at https://example.com/audio.mp3",
    ...
}
```

2. Check our [Common Errors Guide](/docs/guides/common_errors_and_solutions) for solutions to frequently encountered errors and how to resolve them.

3. Still stuck? Contact our support team at [support@assemblyai.com](mailto:support@assemblyai.com). Please include your transcript ID, the audio file/URL you're trying to transcribe, and the JSON response from our server so we can help you faster.
