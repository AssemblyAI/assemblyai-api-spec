title: "Should I use the NA or EU endpoint for my Speech-to-Text requests?"
---

By default, Speech-to-Text requests using pre-recorded audio are sent to our API via the `https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript` endpoint. We also have an option EU endpoint, `https://api.eu.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript` endpoint that can be used for Speech-to-Text requests using pre-recorded audio.

Users should only use this EU endpoint when they have data residency needs that require that data be stored in the EU.

Otherwise, users should use the default NA endpoint as it will generally result in the fastest processing time regardless of what region the user is in.
