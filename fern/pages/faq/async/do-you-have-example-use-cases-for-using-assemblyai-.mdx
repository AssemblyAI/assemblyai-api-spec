Yes! You can find the AssemblyAI Cookbooks here:

[https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides)

AssemblyAI Cookbooks are a resource of code examples, guides, and tutorials for using the AssemblyAI API. They are intended to demonstrate and provide an accompanying code example for use cases using our API. Our team is constantly updating this resource based on our user feedback and feature releases.

Please reach out if you have any ideas or would like to contribute to the code examples!
