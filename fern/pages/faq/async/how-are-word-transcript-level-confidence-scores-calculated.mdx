title: "How are word/transcript level confidence scores calculated?"
---

The confidence scores are derived from the combination of the [softmax layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) from the acoustic model and language model probabilities. The models produce probabilities for each predicted word, and we use those probabilities as confidence scores. The transcript level confidence score is calculated by taking the average of all word-level confidence scores.

Confidence scores fall between `0.0` (low confidence) and `1.0` (high confidence).
