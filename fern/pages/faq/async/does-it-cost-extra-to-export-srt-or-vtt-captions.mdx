title: "Does it cost extra to export SRT or VTT captions?"

It does not!

Customers are not charged an additional amount for exporting `SRT` or `VTT` files. Once a transcription job for a specific transcript ID is completed, the customer will be charged based on the audio duration of the file and the features/models included in that `POST` request. Customers are not charged for `GET` requests including those to export `SRT` or `VTT` captions.
