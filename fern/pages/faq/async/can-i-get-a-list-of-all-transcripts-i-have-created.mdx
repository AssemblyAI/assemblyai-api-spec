title: "Can I get a list of all transcripts I have created?"
---

You can retrieve a list of all transcripts that you have created by [making a `GET` request to the API](https://assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/transcripts/list).

Note historical transcripts can only be retrieved for the last 90 days via this endpoint. If you need transcript information from farther back please reach out to our Support team at support@assemblyai.com.
