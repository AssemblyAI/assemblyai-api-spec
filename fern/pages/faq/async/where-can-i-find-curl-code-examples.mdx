title: "Where can I find cURL code examples?"
---

You can find cURL examples throughout our API reference documentation. Each endpoint includes sample cURL requests that you can copy and modify for your use case.

## Where to find cURL examples

Visit the [API reference section](/docs/api-reference/overview) of our documentation. Each API endpoint page includes cURL code examples.

For example, the [Submit a file for transcription page](/docs/api-reference/transcripts/submit) shows the cURL request format for submitting audio files.

## Converting other code examples to cURL

If you see code examples in other programming languages in our documentation, you can use AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude to convert those examples into cURL format. Simply provide the code example and ask the AI tool to recreate it as a cURL request.
