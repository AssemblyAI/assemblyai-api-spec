title: "Can I customize how words are spelled by the model?"
---

Yes. The Custom Spelling feature gives you the ability to specify how words are spelled or formatted in the transcript text. For example, Custom Spelling could be used to change the spelling of all instances of the word "Ariana" to "Arianna". It could also be used to change the formatting of "CS 50" to "CS50".
