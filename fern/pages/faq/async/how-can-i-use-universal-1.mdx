title: "How can I use Universal-2?"
---

AssemblyAI offers several state-of-the-art speech recognition models, each optimized for different use cases.

The Universal model is our default model for transcribing pre-recorded audio. When you make a request to the `/v2/transcript` endpoint, it will automatically use the latest Universal model, which is currently Universal 2.

Our Universal model is best for out-of-the-box transcription of pre-recorded audio when you need multi-language support, high accuracy, and fast turnaround times.
