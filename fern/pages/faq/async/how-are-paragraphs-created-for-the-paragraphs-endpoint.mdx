title: "How are paragraphs created for the /paragraphs endpoint?"
---

With our `/v2/transcript/{TRANSCRIPT-ID}/paragraphs` endpoint you can export a completed transcript broken into paragraphs. These paragraphs are created using an algorithm that looks at certain heuristics like speaking time, text length, pauses, etc.

See [this section](/docs/pre-recorded-audio/export-paragraphs-and-sentences) of our documentation to learn more about exporting paragraphs.
