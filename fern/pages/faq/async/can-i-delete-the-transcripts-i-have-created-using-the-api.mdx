title: "Can I delete the transcripts I have created using the API?"
---

You can! Completed transcripts are stored indefinitely but they can be deleted at any time using the `DELETE` endpoint covered on [this page](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio#delete-transcripts) of our documentation.

If you are looking to delete transcriptions created via our Playground please reach out to our Support team at [support@assemblyai.com](mailto:support@assemblyai.com).
