title: "How does AssemblyAI compare to other ASR providers?"
---

Our state-of-the-art speech recognition models are trained on extremely large amounts of data to achieve near human-level performance and robustness across a variety of data. As a result, our models typically perform as good or better than the competition. See [our latest benchmark data](https://www.assemblyai.com/benchmarks) to see how we compare to other ASR providers (including AWS, Google, and more) on a wide range of file types.
