# What types of audio URLs can I use with the API?

Your audio URL must:
- Be accessible by our servers
- Point directly to an audio/video file

You can upload your file directly to AssemblyAI's servers using our upload endpoint - [check out our transcription guide to get started](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides/transcribing-an-audio-file).

Alternatively, you can host your files elsewhere. Common approaches are to:

- AWS presigned URLs ([cookbook](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides/transcribe_from_s3))
- Google Drive ([cookbook](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides/transcribing-google-drive-file)) - for files smaller than 100MB 
- GitHub ([cookbook](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides/transcribing-github-files)) - for files smaller than 100MB
- Cloud storage services (GCP/Azure/AWS)
- Any direct download URL that serves audio/video content
