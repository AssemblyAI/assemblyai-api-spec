# How can I summarize my audio file?

We offer two options for summarizing audio data.

### [LeMUR (Recommended)](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/lemur/summarize-audio)

LeMUR is our advanced summarization solution that leverages our largest LLM models. It provides complete control over the summarization process and delivers the highest quality results. This is the recommended option for users who need detailed, customizable summaries of their audio content. 

### [Summarization](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/audio-intelligence/summarization)

Our standard summarization feature generates a single abstractive summary of your entire audio file. Enable it by setting summarization to true in your configuration. You can customize the summary format using `summary_model` (informative or conversational) and `summary_type` (paragraph, bullets, or headline). This is a cost-effective option for straightforward summarization needs.
