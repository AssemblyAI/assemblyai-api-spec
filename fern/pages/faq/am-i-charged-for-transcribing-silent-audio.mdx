# Am I charged for transcribing silent audio?

Yes, our billing is based on audio duration, not the amount of speech content. However, you can use the `speech_threshold` parameter to avoid processing files with minimal speech content. This parameter lets you specify a minimum percentage of speech required for transcription.
