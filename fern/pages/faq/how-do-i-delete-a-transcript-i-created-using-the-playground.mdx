# How do I delete a transcript I created using the Playground?

The Playground is meant to be a quick and easy tool for testing our API. Because of that it doesn't not include all of the same functionality that is available when using our API programmatically, such as the ability to delete transcripts.

Transcripts created via the Playground and the URLs associated with them are valid indefinitely. Because of that, we do not recommend transcribing sensitive information via the Playground.

If you do transcribe something that you would like to have deleted please reach out to us at [support@assemblyai.com](mailto:support@assemblyai.com) and this is something we can assist with as needed.
