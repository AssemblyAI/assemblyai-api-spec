Here's the converted MDX format:

# What standards do your internal password policies follow?

- We use a password manager that defaults passwords to 14 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters.

- To access our dashboard and sign into accounts, users of our services must have 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters matching NIST's requirements.
