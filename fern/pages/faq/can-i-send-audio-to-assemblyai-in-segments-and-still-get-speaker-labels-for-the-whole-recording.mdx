# Can I send audio to AssemblyAI in segments and still get speaker labels for the whole recording?

While AssemblyAI doesn't provide a built-in way to send audio in segments and receive speaker labels for the entire recording, you can achieve this functionality using TitaNet. We have a detailed cookbook that demonstrates this workflow.

## Using TitaNet for Segmented Audio Processing

To process audio in segments while maintaining speaker labels across the entire recording:

1. Use TitaNet to segment your audio
2. Send these segments to AssemblyAI for transcription
3. Combine the results to get speaker labels for the whole recording

## Step-by-Step Guide

For a detailed walkthrough of this process, including code examples, please refer to our cookbook:

[Speaker Diarization with Async Chunking](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides/speaker-diarization-with-async-chunking)

This cookbook provides a comprehensive guide on how to implement speaker diarization with asynchronous chunking, allowing you to process large audio files in segments while maintaining accurate speaker labels across the entire recording.
