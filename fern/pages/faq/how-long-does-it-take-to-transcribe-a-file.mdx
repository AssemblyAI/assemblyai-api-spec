# How long does it take to transcribe a file?

Processing times for our asynchronous transcription API are based on the duration of the submitted audio and models enabled in the request but the vast majority of files sent to our API will complete in **under 45 seconds**, and with a Real-Time-Factor (RTF) as low as .008x.

To put an RTF of .008x into perspective, this means you can convert a:

- 1h3min (75MB) meeting in 35 seconds
- 3h15min (191MB) podcast in 133 seconds
- 8h21min (464MB) video course in 300 seconds

Files submitted for Streaming Speech-to-Text receive a response within a few hundred milliseconds.
