title: "What is your API Uptime SLA?"
---

Our SLA guarantees an  uptime of 99.9%  for our API service. This commitment means that, within a given year our service will not be unavailable for more than 8 hours and 46 minutes (526 mins).

Our service's uptime is measured on an annual basis. We continuously monitor the availability of our API endpoints. A period is considered "downtime" when a significant number of requests to our API fail. Scheduled maintenance periods, which we announce in advance, are not included in this calculation.

<Note>

    We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our cloud provider. Our infrastructure is designed to be highly available, utilizing multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZs) to protect against single points of failure. Even if an entire AWS AZ were to go down, our service would continue operating from other healthy zones, however we must account for AWS' SLAs for uptime in our calculations.
