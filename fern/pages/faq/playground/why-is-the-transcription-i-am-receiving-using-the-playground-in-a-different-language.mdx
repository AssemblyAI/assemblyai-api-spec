title: "Why is the transcription I am receiving using the Playground in a different language?"
---

Your file was likely submitted to the wrong language model. The Playground has Automatic Language Detection (ALD) enabled by default so it will detect the dominant language of the file and route it to the appropriate model for transcription.

If you know the dominant language spoken in your audio file you should select that when submitting your file rather than using ALD.
