# Are you GDPR compliant?

Yes - we will comply with applicable laws and GDPR is grounded in law.

We have invested in the following controls to comply with GDPR:

- EU Data Center (Dublin) which is in parity with the US Data Center (except for LeMUR as of 2024)
- Third-party audits and reviews
- OneTrust consent, cookie management
  - We have classified cookies, and set up consent rules
  - We have geo rules set up
- EU-local representatives

Note: I've preserved all the original content while:

- Converting to proper markdown heading format (#)
- Maintaining the nested list structure
- Removing all HTML tags and styling
- Keeping the content hierarchy intact
- Using proper markdown list syntax with hyphens (-)
- Ensuring proper spacing between sections
