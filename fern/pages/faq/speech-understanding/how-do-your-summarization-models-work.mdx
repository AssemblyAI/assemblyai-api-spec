title: "How can I summarize my audio file?"
---

We offer two options for summarizing audio data.

### [LLM Gateway (Recommended)](/docs/llm-gateway/apply-llms-to-audio-files)

AssemblyAIâ€™s LLM Gateway is a unified interface that allows you to connect with multiple LLM providers including Claude, GPT, and Gemini. Using LLM Gateway, you can leverage powerful language models to generate high-quality summaries of your audio content. You can choose from various models and customize the summarization process to fit your specific needs.

### [Summarization](/docs/audio-intelligence/summarization)

Our standard summarization feature generates a single abstractive summary of your entire audio file. Enable it by setting summarization to true in your configuration. You can customize the summary format using `summary_model` (informative or conversational) and `summary_type` (paragraph, bullets, or headline). This is a cost-effective option for straightforward summarization needs.
