title: "How does Auto-pay work?"
---

Auto-pay automatically recharges your account when your balance falls below a specified threshold. When triggered, it charges your card to bring your balance back to a predetermined amount. Auto-pay is recommended for production environments to prevent service interruptions.

### Example

If you set:

- Whenever my balance falls below: \$25
- Bring my balance back to: \$50

When your balance of \$26 drops to \$21 after a \$5 charge, auto-pay will add \$29 to reach your \$50 target balance.

<Note>
  When your balance hits \$0 without auto-pay, your API access is restricted
  until you add funds.
</Note>

Enable auto-pay and maintain a healthy balance to ensure uninterrupted API access. Set your threshold based on your typical monthly usage to avoid frequent small charges.

You can also disable auto-pay at any time through your account settings.
