title: "How does pricing work?"
---

Our pricing is Pay-As-You-Go. For pre-recorded audio, pricing is based on the duration of the audio file submitted, the Speech Model selected, and the features used in the request. For streaming audio, pricing is based on the duration of the streaming session. For LLM Gateway, pricing is based on input and output token size.

You can find the breakdown of all our pricing information on our [Pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing)!
