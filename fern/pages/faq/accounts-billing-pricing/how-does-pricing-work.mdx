title: "How does pricing work?"
---

Our pricing is Pay-As-You-Go. For pre-recorded audio, pricing is based on the duration of the audio file submitted, the Speech Model selected, and the features used in the request. For streaming audio, pricing is based on the duration of the streaming session.

Current pricing for pre-recorded audio on the Universal tier is \$0.27 per hour, and the Nano tier is \$0.12 per hour. Streaming STT is \$0.15 per hour. Audio Intelligence pricing depends on the models being used. LeMUR pricing is based on input and output size.

You can find the breakdown of all our pricing information on our [Pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing)!

## Pricing Structure (pre-recorded audio)

- We charge based on the actual duration of your audio/video files in seconds
- Rates are listed per hour for simplicity (e.g., \$0.27/hour), but we pro-rate to the exact second
- Additional features (like Entity Detection) are also charged at their respective hourly rates

## Pricing Structure (streaming audio)

- We charge based on the duration of the created session

## Credit System

- Add credits to your account balance
- Credits are deducted only after successful transcription completion
- Failed transcripts are not charged
- We don't offer unlimited usage plans or monthly subscriptions - we only charge you for what you use.

## Example

A 30-minute file at \$0.12/hour would cost \$0.06 (30 minutes = 0.5 hours × \$0.12). If you add Entity Detection at \$0.08/hour, the total would be \$0.10 `(\$0.12 + \$0.08) × 0.5`.
