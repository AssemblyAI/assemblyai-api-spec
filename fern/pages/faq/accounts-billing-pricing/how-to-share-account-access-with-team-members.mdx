title: "How to Share Account Access with Team Members"
---

While our platform only allows a single email address and API key per account, there are ways to effectively share access with your team members. Here's how you can manage shared access:

## Creating a Shared Team Account

The recommended approach for team access is to create a shared account:

1. Set up a new account using a shared email address (e.g., dev@yourcompany.com)
2. Securely share the account credentials with team members using a password manager

## Best Practices for Shared Accounts

- Use a generic email address that isn't tied to a specific individual
- Implement strong password policies
- Regularly review and update access as team members join or leave

## Changing the Email Address on an Existing Account

If you need to update the email address associated with your account to a shared email:

1. Contact our support team
2. Request an email address change for your account
3. Provide the new shared email address you'd like to use

<Note>
  Remember: Each account can only have one email address and API key. Changing
  the email will affect all access associated with the account.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage shared access to your account while maintaining security and control over your team's usage of our platform.
