Yes! You can use the API for free on a limited trial. Simply add a credit card to your account at any time to upgrade from the trial.

An account on the free tier has access to our pre-recorded audio transcription and Audio Intelligence features using our Async `/v2/transcript` endpoint. It also has access to our streaming STT feature using our `wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/ws` endpoint.

An account on the free tier can transcribe up to \$50 in transcription and will be able to process up to five files concurrently. If you upgrade your account before using \$50 in transcription any unused amount will be retained on your account.

Once you have transcribed \$50 worth of files you will need to upgrade your account to continue using the API.

<Note>
  The free tier does not include access to LeMUR. To use LeMUR, you will need to
  upgrade your account by adding a credit card.
