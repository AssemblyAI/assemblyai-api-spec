title: "How do I add developers to my account?"
---

Currently, our system supports only one email account per user account. This means that adding multiple developers to a single team account is not directly possible at this time.

## Recommended workaround

To share access among team members, we recommend using a password manager like 1Password. This allows you to securely share the account credentials between multiple developers.

## Steps to share access:

1. Set up a shared vault in your password manager
2. Store the account credentials in this shared vault
3. Invite team members to access the shared vault
4. Team members can now use the shared credentials to access the account

<Note>
  When sharing credentials, ensure all team members follow best practices for
  security, such as using strong, unique passwords and enabling two-factor
  authentication where possible.

## Future updates

We are actively working on improving our dashboard to support multi-user accounts. These improvements are expected to be available towards the end of Q4. Once released, you'll be able to add multiple developers to your team directly within the platform.
