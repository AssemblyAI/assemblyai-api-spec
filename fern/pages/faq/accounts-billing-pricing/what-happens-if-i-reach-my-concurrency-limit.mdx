### Async speech-to-text

When you reach your concurrency limit, new requests are automatically queued. As soon as a current transcription completes, the next job in the queue begins processing. All transcripts will be processed, though queued jobs may take longer than usual.

For example, if a user's concurrency limit is set to 200 and they submit 201 transcript requests, the user will receive a throttle alert email. The first 200 transcription requests will begin to process immediately. The 201st one will wait until one of the previous 200 requests has finished before processing.

### Streaming

When you reach your streaming concurrency limit, new requests will receive a `1008` error with the message "`Unauthorized connection: Too many concurrent sessions`".

Note: Our Streaming STT feature includes automatically scaling concurrency. Anytime you are using 70% or more of your streaming concurrency your concurrency limit will automatically increase by 10% every sixty seconds.

You can find more information on Concurrency Limits in our Documentation [here](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/concepts/concurrency-limit).
