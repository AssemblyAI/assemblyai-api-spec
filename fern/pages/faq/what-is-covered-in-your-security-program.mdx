# What is covered in your security program?

All staff are required to view security awareness training within 30 days of first hire, and annually thereafter. Topics include:

- GDPR
- PCI
- Phishing
- HIPAA Compliance
- CCPA
- Secure Coding
- Threat Modelling

Note: I've converted this to MDX by:

1. Adding a main title with #
2. Converting the unordered list to markdown format with dashes
3. Removing all HTML tags and styling while preserving content
4. Maintaining proper spacing and formatting
5. Keeping all original content intact
