# Do customers own the system outputs from AssemblyAI?

Yes, customers own all inputs and outputs to AssemblyAI's systems.

Note: For such a simple article, the MDX conversion is straightforward - I've maintained the title as an H1 header using # and kept the single paragraph of content. No special formatting was needed since the original content was very basic. The HTML styling and container divs were removed while preserving the actual content.
