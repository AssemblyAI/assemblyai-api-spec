# What are my concurrency limits?

A concurrency limit is the number of requests that can be processed for an account at any given time. 

Each account has an assigned concurrency limit (also referred to as a throttle limit). For free accounts, the default is 5 for Asynchronous and Streaming transcriptions. For upgraded accounts, the default is 200 for Asynchronous transcriptions and 100 for Streaming transcriptions.

You can check your concurrency limits [on your dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account).

### Asynchronous speech-to-text limits

Below are the default limits for how many requests you can have processing in parallel when submitting jobs to our `/v2/transcript` endpoint.

| Account type | Concurrency limit |
|-------------|------------------|
| Free | 5 |
| Pro | 200 |

### Streaming speech-to-text limits

Below are the default limits for how many Streaming sessions you can have open in parallel.

| Account type | Concurrency limit |
|-------------|------------------|
| Free | 5 |
| Pro | 100 |

Note: Our Streaming STT feature includes automatically scaling concurrency. Anytime you are using 70% or more of your streaming concurrency, your concurrency limit will automatically increase by 10% every sixty seconds.

You can find more information on Concurrency Limits in our Documentation [here](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/concepts/concurrency-limit)!

### Need a higher concurrency?

We offer custom concurrency limits that scale to support any workload at no additional cost. If you need a higher concurrency limit please either [contact our Sales team](https://www.assemblyai.com/contact) or reach out to us at [support@assemblyai.com](mailto:support@assemblyai.com).

### Rate Limits

In addition to the concurrency limit, there's a rate limit for the API, which restricts users to a maximum of 20,000 requests per five minutes.
