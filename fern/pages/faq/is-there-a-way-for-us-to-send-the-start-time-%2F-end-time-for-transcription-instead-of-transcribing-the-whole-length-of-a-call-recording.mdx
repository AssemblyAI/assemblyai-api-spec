# Is there a way for us to send the start time / end time for transcription instead of transcribing the whole length of a call recording?

Yes, you can!

There are parameters that you can add to your `POST` request that allow you to set the start time and end time of where you would like to start/stop transcribing your audio file.

More specifically you can use the `audio_start_from` parameter and enter the time in milliseconds of where you would like to start transcribing your media file and the `audio_end_at` parameter and enter the time in milliseconds of where you'd like to stop transcribing your media file.

The parameters are referenced in the [Set the start and end of the transcript](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/set-the-start-and-end-of-the-transcript) section of our documentation.
