# What audio and video file types are supported by your API?

The AssemblyAI API supports most common audio and video file formats. We recommend that you submit your audio in its native format without additional transcoding or file conversion. Transcoding or converting it to another format can sometimes result in a loss of quality, especially if you're converting compressed formats like `.mp3`. The AssemblyAI API converts all files to 16khz uncompressed audio as part of our transcription pipeline.

Note that when you upload a video to our API, the audio will be extracted from it and processed independently, so the list of supported video formats isn't exhaustive.
