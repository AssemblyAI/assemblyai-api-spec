# Context

When working with audio files, you may want to reduce background noise to improve the listening experience for your users. There are different solutions available depending on your specific needs and resources.

# Answer

There are two main approaches you can take for audio noise reduction:

## 1. Commercial Solution

[Krisp](https://krisp.ai/developers/#technologies) is a recommended commercial solution for background noise reduction. They offer an SDK that can be integrated into your application.

## 2. Open Source Solution

If you prefer more customization and control over processing costs, you can use open-source solutions such as the [noisereduce](https://github.com/timsainb/noisereduce) library.

For implementation examples with realtime audio using the open-source approach, you can refer to our [streaming API cookbook](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides/noise_reduction_streaming).

Note: If you're using our transcription service, we recommend applying noise reduction for playback purposes only, not before transcription.
