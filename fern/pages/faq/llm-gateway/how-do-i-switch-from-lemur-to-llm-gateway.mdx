title: "How do I switch from using LeMUR to using LLM Gateway?"
---

To switch from LeMUR to LLM Gateway, you need to make three key changes: include the transcript text directly in your request instead of passing transcript IDs, update the model name format, and modify your response handling to use the OpenAI-compatible format.

With LeMUR, you passed `transcript_ids` and the system automatically fetched the transcript content. With LLM Gateway, you first retrieve the transcript text and include it in your message content when calling the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint at `llm-gateway.assemblyai.com`.

For a detailed step-by-step walkthrough with code examples in Python and JavaScript, see the [Migration Guide: From LeMUR to LLM Gateway](/docs/llm-gateway/migration-from-lemur).
