Here's the converted MDX format:

# How do we securely use your service?

Our service is reached by creating a websocket connection with `44.238.19.20`. We use WSS 2 connections to ensure that the connection is secure. Organizations with firewalls will typically allowlist the IP address so they can post/get files from our API endpoint.

Outputs are simply text files, so conducting file scanning on get requests on the corporate firewall can be useful in maintaining a strong posture while using our services.

Note: The content has been converted to clean MDX format with:
- Proper h1 title using #
- Code formatting preserved using backticks
- Paragraphs properly separated
- All HTML styling and container tags removed
- Content structure maintained
