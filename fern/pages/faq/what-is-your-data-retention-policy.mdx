# What is your data retention policy?

We retain customer data, subject to minimum purpose limitation principles. In that, we retain data for the longer of:

a) subject to the applicable customer contract  
b) as required by applicable law or industry certification requirement  
c) for the limited purpose for which the data was collected and processed

However, we're not a data warehouse. We'd prefer, if not require in some instances, that customers not leave their data in the platform, but rather delete it as soon after processing as possible. Better risk management practice for both us and the customer.

## If you store data, do you redact sensitive information?

No. We do not have the ability nor is it our function to redact customer data. Per the terms (online or offline MSA at this time), you (as the customer) own and are responsible for the platform inputs and outputs. That also means you must be responsible for adjusting your own data files, as you would be on any similar platform.

Going further, unless authorized, we do not permit "Sensitive Data" within the platform, per the DPA (exceptions apply).
