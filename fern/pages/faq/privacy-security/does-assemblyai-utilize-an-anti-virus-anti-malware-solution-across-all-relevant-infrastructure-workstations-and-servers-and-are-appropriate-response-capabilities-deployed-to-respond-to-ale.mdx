title: "Does AssemblyAI utilize an anti-virus/anti-malware solution across all relevant infrastructure (workstations and servers), and are appropriate response capabilities deployed to respond to alerts?"

Yes. We have antimalware installed on corporate endpoints and ingress points within our production environment. We monitor for suspicious activity and have data loss prevention (DLP) alerts set up so that we can respond as quickly as possible.
