title: "Do you offer servers in the EU?"

Yes, we have an endpoint in AWS EU West 1 (Dublin) for async transcription. Support for LLM Gateway and Streaming Speech-to-Text will be added in the future.

If your use-case requires EU Data Residency, you can enable this by using the base URL of `api.eu.assemblyai.com`. See [this section](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/select-the-region) of our documentation for code examples showing how to change the base URL.

See [this cookbook](/docs/guides/how_to_use_the_eu_endpoint) for specific code examples showing how to change the base URL with our different SDKs.
