AssemblyAI has opted out of data training with all LLM Gateway providers.

Please note this is separate from whether AssemblyAI may train our models with your data. You can find more information on if and how to opt out of data sharing for our model improvement program [here](/docs/faq/how-to-opt-out-of-data-sharing-for-our-model-improvement-program).
