---

AssemblyAI provides an option for customers to opt out of having their data used for training our models. If you wish to opt out of this data sharing for our model improvement program, follow these steps:

## Opting Out Process

1. Send an email to [data-opt-out@assemblyai.com](mailto:data-opt-out@assemblyai.com)
2. Ensure you send the email from the address associated with your AssemblyAI account
3. In the email, clearly state your request to opt out of data sharing for model training
4. Once we receive and process your request, we will respond with an email confirmation of your opt-out status. Your opt-out status will be effective from the time of that confirmation going forward

<Note>
  By opting out of the model improvement program, you are forgoing the discounts listed on our [pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing).
</Note>

<Note>
  Free users do not have the ability to opt out of model improvement program. If you would like to move to a paid plan to access opt-out functionality, please upgrade [here](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/account/pricing).

## Important Notes

For further information on how we train our models, please see [our FAQ on model training](/docs/faq/are-files-submitted-to-the-api-used-for-model-training).

There may be a limited delay from the time you send the opt-out request to our team to when your request is processed.

Opt-out requests are forward-looking only. At this time, we do not have the ability to retroactively apply opt-out requests.

If you have any questions about this process, you can contact our support team for assistance. To do that, please contact us here via live chat or email: https://www.assemblyai.com/contact/support

By following these steps, you can ensure that your data is not used for training our models while still benefiting from our services.
