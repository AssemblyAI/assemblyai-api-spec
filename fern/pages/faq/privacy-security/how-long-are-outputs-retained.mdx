For more information on how AssemblyAI maintains audio and transcript data, please see [here](/docs/faq/how-long-does-aai-retain-data).

For customers with a BAA, all transcripts generated via the async transcription endpoint will be deleted after the TTL period (currently set to 3 days by default).
