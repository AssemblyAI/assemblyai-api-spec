title: "How long are outputs retained?"
---

Outputs are retained indefinitely. For more information on how AssemblyAI maintains audio and transcript data, please see [here](https://support.assemblyai.com/articles/2240096256-does-assemblyai-offer-zero-data-retention).

Starting on 11-26-2024, AssemblyAI will assign an account-level Time to Live (TTL) for customers who have executed a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with us. For those customers, all transcripts generated via the async transcription endpoint will be deleted after the TTL period (currently set to 3 days by default).
