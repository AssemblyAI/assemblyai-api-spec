title: "Do you offer EU Data Residency?"
---

For users who need to process data within European Union data centers, we offer access to European servers via our EU endpoint, which runs on AWS servers located in the EU West 1 (Dublin) region.

Here are some benefits of EU Data Residency:

- Instant EU processing via API parameters and dedicated endpoint
- Continued data sovereignty for EU operations
- Regional usage tracking and cost management in your dashboard

See [our documentation](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/select-the-region) to learn more about using our EU endpoint.
