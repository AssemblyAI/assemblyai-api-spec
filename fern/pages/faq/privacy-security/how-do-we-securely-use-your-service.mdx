title: "How do we securely use your service?"
---

Our service is reached by creating a websocket connection with `44.238.19.20`. We use WSS 2 connections to ensure that the connection is secure. Organizations with firewalls will typically allowlist the IP address so they can post/get files from our API endpoint.

Outputs are simply text files, so conducting file scanning on get requests on the corporate firewall can be useful in maintaining a strong posture while using our services.
