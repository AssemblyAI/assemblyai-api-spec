---

AssemblyAI enables covered entities and their business associates subject to HIPAA to use the AssemblyAI services to process protected health information (PHI). AssemblyAI is considered a business associate under HIPAA, and we offer a standard Business Associate Addendum (BAA) that is required under HIPAA to ensure that AAI appropriately safeguards PHI. Our BAA is available [here](https://www.assemblyai.com/legal/business-associate-agreement). If you'd like to execute a BAA, please [contact our Sales team](https://www.assemblyai.com/contact/sales).
