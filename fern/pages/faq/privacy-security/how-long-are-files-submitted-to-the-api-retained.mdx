title: "How long are files submitted to the API retained?"
---

Files submitted to our `v2/upload` endpoint are retained for 2 days.

Files submitted to our `v2/transcript` endpoint via a direct audio URL are retained for 3 days by default but can be deleted immediately with [a DELETE request](/docs/api-reference/transcripts/delete).

You can also permanently and immediately [delete the transcript](/docs/api-reference/transcripts/delete) itself at any time.

If you are interested in smaller data retention windows, please review our guide on [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](/docs/faq/does-assemblyai-offer-zero-data-retention).
