title: "How does AssemblyAI back up inputs to its system?"
---

AssemblyAI does not store inputs to its systems. Infrastructure components are deployed as code, services can be redeployed quickly using standard images. Transcripts are not backed up, but are sent to storage with 99.999999% durability (AWS S3) and can be deleted by the customer [submitting a delete request using the delete endpoint](/docs/api-reference/transcripts/delete). Clustered backup and backup regions are being prioritized by our team.
