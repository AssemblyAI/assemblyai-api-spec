title: "Are files submitted to the API used for model training?"
---

At this time, we do not use customer data to train our models. However, our terms permit this use, including for product development/model training, and we may at some point switch to ingesting data.

Such data is critical to building out the best services, functions, and offerings for our customers. However, for those customers who would prefer we not train on their data, or cannot permit, e.g., due to HIPAA or other regulatory limitations, we:

- offer an opt-out, or
- would agree to prohibit by contract.

To opt out of data training, please reach out to [support@assemblyai.com](mailto:support@assemblyai.com) as outlined in section 4.4 in [our Terms of Service](https://www.assemblyai.com/legal/terms-of-service).

<Note>
  Opting out only applies to future training. We cannot untrain or remove data
  from models retroactively.
