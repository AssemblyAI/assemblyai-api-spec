title: "Are files submitted to the API used for model training?"
---

We consider model training critical to providing you with the most accurate models and services that we can. Only certain files submitted to the API, as permitted by the applicable contract, are used for model training. These files undergo a redaction process designed to redact personally identifiable information before any remaining data is used for model training. We will not use files you submit for model training if you are subject to a Business Associate Addendum, are utilizing our European servers, or if you have opted out from model training. You can find more information on if and how to opt out [here](https://support.assemblyai.com/articles/5930031898-how-to-opt-out-of-data-sharing-for-model-training).
