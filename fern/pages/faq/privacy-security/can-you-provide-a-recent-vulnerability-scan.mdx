title: "Can you provide a recent vulnerability scan?"

We can provide ASV scans to customers with a signed NDA. ASV scans are uncredentialed vulnerability scans directed to production endpoints that report on exposed vulnerabilities. We produce these quarterly at a minimum to maintain our PCI certification.
