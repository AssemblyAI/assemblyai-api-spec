# Does AssemblyAI use encryption?

Data at rest is encrypted with AES 128 or AES-256, and data in transit uses TLS 1.2+. AssemblyAI posts SSL scans quarterly to its [Trust Center](https://app.vanta.com/assemblyai/trust/7n80syl8zln1bn1qm3x8eg) to verify the use of TLS with modern ciphersuites to its service.
