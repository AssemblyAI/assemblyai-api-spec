# What is the recommended file type for using your API?

Our API supports a wide range of file types so we typically recommend customers submit their audio in whatever its raw format is without any type of transcoding or file conversion. The reason for this is that transcoding or converting it to another format can sometimes result in a loss of quality.

Some formats like `.wav` are lossless while others like `.mp3` and `.acc` are lossy. Check out [this article](https://higherhz.com/lossless-vs-lossy-compression-audio-formats/) to learn more. This difference between lossless and lossy is part of the reason we suggest people submit their audio as is without any modification.

We have transcoding on our end that will take the incoming files and convert them to 16khz `.wav` files so regardless of the file type submitted they will be able to work with our transcription pipeline.
