# How can I integrate AssemblyAI with other services?

We have existing integrations with services such as Zapier, LangChain, AWS, and more! You can find our existing integrations with other tools and services in our Documentation here: [https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/integrations](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/integrations)

Using AssemblyAI API involves making GET and POST requests so as long as you can make those you can use our API with any language, framework, or library.
