# What languages do you support?

This page shows which languages are supported by the AssemblyAI Async API, their `language_code` values, and the features available for that language.

AssemblyAI offers two different classes of speech-to-text models: **Best** and **Nano**.

Below, you'll find the supported languages for each class of models, as well as instructions on how to change the language for your transcription.

## Supported languages for Best

*Note: Since the original content uses iframes to display language tables, you'll need to create static markdown tables with the supported languages and their codes. The specific language data should be added here in markdown table format.*

## Supported languages for Nano

*Note: Similarly, Nano supported languages should be listed here in a markdown table format*

## Specify the language

You can use the optional `language_code` parameter to specify the language of the spoken audio in the files that you submit to the API. If you don't include a `language_code` parameter in your request, it defaults to `en_us`.

To learn more about using the `language_code` parameter, see [Set language manually](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-to-text/speech-recognition#set-language-manually).

<Note>
If you're unsure of the spoken language spoken in your audio file, you can use our [Automatic Language Detection](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-to-text/speech-recognition#automatic-language-detection) feature to automatically identify the dominant language in your file.

## Specify the speech model

You can use the optional `speech_model` parameter to specify the class of models. To learn more, see [Select the speech model](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-to-text/speech-recognition#select-the-speech-model-with-best-and-nano).

<Note>
Note: The information on this page is specific to our Async Speech-to-Text feature for pre-recorded audio.

Our Streaming Speech-to-Text feature only supports English and its various dialects so there is no option to specify a language with that feature.
