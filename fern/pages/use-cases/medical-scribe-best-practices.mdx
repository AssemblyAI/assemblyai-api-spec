## When Should I Use Pre-recorded vs Streaming for Medical Scribes?

Understanding when to use async (pre-recorded) versus streaming is critical for clinical workflows.

### Use Pre-recorded (Universal-3-Pro) when:

**Post-visit documentation** - Encounter already happened, need highest accuracy

- **Maximum accuracy required** - Universal-3-Pro has highest medical terminology accuracy
- **Complex medical terminology** - Rare medications, genetic conditions, specialized procedures
- **HIPAA compliance critical** - Full PII redaction with audio de-identification
- **Structured note generation** - SOAP notes, H&P, discharge summaries via LLM Gateway
- **Quality assurance** - Review and editing workflow needed
- **Specialty documentation** - Oncology, cardiology, neurology with complex terminology
- **Speaker diarization needed** - Automatic provider vs. patient separation

**Best for:** Post-visit SOAP notes, specialist consultations, hospital discharge summaries, quality review

### Use Streaming (Universal-Streaming) When:

**Live encounter documentation** - Real-time transcription during patient visit

- **Immediate documentation** - No delay between encounter and note
- **Telemedicine visits** - Document while seeing patient virtually
- **Emergency department** - Fast-paced, immediate documentation needed
- **Primary care visits** - Standard encounters with common terminology
- **Real-time review** - Provider can review and correct during visit
- **Ambient documentation** - Microphone running throughout encounter

**Best for:** Telemedicine, primary care visits, ED encounters, real-time clinical decision support

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

Many medical scribes use **both**:

1. **Streaming during visit** - Real-time documentation, immediate review by provider
2. **Universal-3-Pro post-processing** - Run audio through Universal-3-Pro after visit for:
   - Highest accuracy verification
   - Complex terminology correction
   - Complete HIPAA compliance workflow
   - Final structured note generation
   - Speaker diarization (provider vs. patient)

**Example workflow:**

- Provider sees patient → Streaming captures real-time notes
- Visit ends → Audio sent to Universal-3-Pro for final high-accuracy transcription
- LLM Gateway generates structured SOAP note from high-accuracy transcript
- Provider reviews and signs final note

This gives real-time utility during visits while ensuring maximum accuracy for official documentation.

## What Workflows Can I Build for My AI Medical Scribe?

Use these flags to transform raw medical conversations into structured clinical documentation. Below is plain-English behavior, output shape, and clinical use cases for each option.

### Entity Detection (Medical)

`entity_detection: true`

**What it does:** Extracts medical entities (medications, conditions, procedures, anatomy).

**Output:** Array of `{ entity_type, text, start, end, confidence }`.

**Great for:** Medication reconciliation, problem list updates, procedure coding.

**Notes:** Recognizes brand/generic drug names, medical conditions, surgical procedures.

### Redact PII Text (HIPAA Compliance)

`redact_pii: true`

**What it does:** Scans transcript for Protected Health Information and **replaces** per HIPAA requirements.

**Output:** `text` with PHI replaced; original timing preserved.

**Great for:** De-identification, research datasets, training data.

**Notes:** Covers all 18 HIPAA identifiers when properly configured.

`redact_pii_policies: [person_name, date_of_birth, medical_record_number, phone_number, email_address]`

Restricts redaction scope to key HIPAA identifiers:

- **`person_name`** – patient and provider names
- **`date_of_birth`** – full or partial DOB
- **`medical_record_number`** – MRN, account numbers
- **`phone_number`** – contact numbers
- **`email_address`** – electronic addresses

**Why this set:** Ensures HIPAA compliance while preserving clinical content for documentation.

`redact_pii_sub: hash`

**What it does:** Replaces each PHI span with a **stable hash token**.

**Example:**
`"Patient John Doe, DOB 1/15/1980, MRN 12345"` ⟶
`"Patient #2af4…, DOB #7b91…, MRN #e13c…"`

**Benefits:**

- Maintains referential integrity across document
- Preserves sentence structure for NLP/LLM processing
- Prevents reconstruction of original PHI

### Redact PII Audio (HIPAA Compliance)

`redact_pii_audio: true`

**What it does:** Produces HIPAA-compliant audio with PHI portions silenced.

**Output:** `redacted_audio_url` in the transcript payload.

**Great for:** Quality assurance, training, research.

**Notes:** Original audio preserved separately; ensure proper access controls.

### Sentiment Analysis (Patient Experience)

`sentiment_analysis: true`

**What it does:** Analyzes emotional tone of patient responses.

**Output:** Array of `{ text, sentiment, confidence, start, end }`.

**Great for:** Patient satisfaction, pain assessment, mental health screening.

**Notes:** Helpful for identifying distressed or dissatisfied patients.

| `entity_detection`        | Medical entities extracted | EHR integration, coding    |
| `sentiment_analysis`      | Patient emotion tracking   | Quality metrics, alerts    |
| `redact_pii` (+ policies) | HIPAA-compliant **text**   | Research, QA, training     |
| `redact_pii_sub=hash`     | Stable PHI placeholders    | Analytics & LLM processing |
| `redact_pii_audio`        | De-identified **audio**    | Compliance archives        |

### Clinical Documentation Example

**Original Encounter:**

> "Hi, I'm _Dr. Smith_. _John Doe_, born _1/15/1980_, is here for follow-up. He's taking _metformin 1000mg twice daily_ for his _diabetes_."

**With medical scribe settings:**

- **Text:** "Hi, I'm **#2af4…**. **#7b91…**, born **#e13c…**, is here for follow-up. He's taking _metformin 1000mg twice daily_ for his _diabetes_."
- **Entities:** `[ { type: "medication", text: "metformin 1000mg" }, { type: "condition", text: "diabetes" } ]`
- **Clinical note:** Structured SOAP format via LLM Gateway
- **Redacted audio:** PHI portions silenced for compliance

### LLM Gateway for Clinical Notes

## How Can I Improve the Latency of My Medical Scribe?

### Async Chunking for Long Encounters

For lengthy patient visits, implement chunking to get progressive documentation. This is especially useful for:

- Hospital rounds (in-person microphone running ambient)
- Comprehensive physicals
- Specialty consultations

### When to Use Streaming Instead

For optimal clinical workflow integration, streaming is ideal when:

1. **Real-time documentation needed:**

   - Emergency department encounters
   - Telemedicine visits
   - Procedure documentation

2. **Immediate clinical decision support:**

   - Medication interaction checking
   - Diagnosis suggestion
   - Protocol reminders

3. **Live quality assurance:**
   - Compliance monitoring
   - Training supervision
   - Documentation coaching

Streaming provides:

- ~300ms latency for immediate documentation
- Real-time partial results for provider review
- No delay between encounter end and note availability
- Live clinical decision support integration

## How Can I Use Speaker Identification for Doctor and Patient Recognition?

Speaker Identification can automatically distinguish between doctors and patients in medical encounters, replacing generic "Speaker A" and "Speaker B" labels with meaningful role-based identifiers.

### Why Use Speaker Identification in Medical Scribes?

**Clinical Benefits:**

- **Clear attribution** - Know exactly who said what in clinical documentation
- **SOAP note structure** - Automatically separate subjective (patient) from objective (provider) statements
- **Compliance documentation** - Proper attribution for regulatory requirements
- **Quality assurance** - Review provider-patient communication patterns
- **Training analysis** - Analyze communication styles for medical education

### Medical Speaker Identification Setup

#### Method 1: Role-Based Identification (Recommended)

<Code src="../../snippets/use-cases/medical-scribe-best-practices/python-14.py" />
#### Method 2: Name-Based Identification
