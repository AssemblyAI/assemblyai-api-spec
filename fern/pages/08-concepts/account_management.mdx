On the [AssemblyAI dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/app), you can manage your projects and API keys, and see a breakdown of your usage and spend.

## Projects

Projects can be used to isolate data for different environments or applications, e.g., production, staging, or development. Each project has its own API keys, allowing for better organization and data access control.

Transcripts and other project-specific data is accessible only within the project they were created in â€” An API key from one project will not be able to access historical transcripts or data from another project. This separation maintains data security and prevents unintended cross-project access.

You can create, rename, and delete projects based on your plan:

| Usage limits       | Free | PAYG | Contracted | Enterprise |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Number of projects | 2    | 2    | 5          | Custom     |

## API Keys

API keys are unique credentials that authenticate requests to the API. Each API key is associated with a specific project, ensuring secure and controlled access.

You can create and delete API keys based on your plan:

| Usage limits       | Free | PAYG | Contracted | Enterprise |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Number of API keys | 2    | 4    | 25         | Custom     |

### Create a new API Key

1. Log in to your [AssemblyAI Dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" section
3. Click the "Create New API Key" button
4. Enter a descriptive name for your API key (e.g., "Production API", "Development API")
5. Click "Create"

### Delete an API Key

1. Log in to your [AssemblyAI Dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" section
3. Locate the API key you want to delete
4. Click the "Delete" button next to the key
5. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog

<Error>
  This action cannot be undone. Make sure no active applications are using the
  key before deletion.
</Error>

## Reporting

Get insights into your usage and spend to track and manage costs effectively with the reporting tool in the AssemblyAI dashboard. You can analyze your usage and spend data at different levels of granularity:

- Account
- Product (e.g., Speech-to-text, Streaming, LeMUR)
- Models (e.g., Best, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.)
- Project
- API key

## Usage Limits

<Note>

With the current version of multi-project support, rate limiting is applied at the account level, not at the project level. This means that the rate limits for each API key mirror the rate limits for the account.

Example: If an account has an Async concurrency of 200, each API key for that account will be able to process up to 200 requests concurrently.

</Note>

To ensure a smooth experience for all users, certain operations have per-account usage limits.

- **Concurrency limits** for asynchronous operations
- **Rate limits** for synchronous operations

<Note title="Need a higher concurrency?">

Our services are infinitely scalable and we offer custom concurrency limits that scale to support any workload at no additional cost. If you need a higher concurrency limit please either contact our{" "} <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/contact" target="_blank"> Sales team </a>{" "} or send an email to our [Support team](https://www.assemblyai.com/contact/support).

</Note>

### Speech-to-Text usage limits

AssemblyAI limits the number of transcriptions being processed at any given time.

| Usage limit               | Free account | Paid account |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Concurrent transcriptions | 5            | 200          |

If you submit a transcription that would exceed your usage limit, it'll be added to a queue. Queued transcriptions will be processed automatically as previously submitted transcriptions complete.

If your account balance goes below zero, your concurrency limit will be reduced to 1.

If you exceed your concurrency limit, you'll receive an email stating that your transcripts have been throttled. Note that you'll only receive this email once per day.

### Streaming Speech-to-Text usage limits

AssemblyAI limits the number of concurrent streaming sessions.

| Usage limit                   | Free account | Paid account |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Concurrent Streaming sessions | 5            | 100          |

<Tip>
Our Streaming STT feature includes automatically scaling concurrency limits for paid accounts.

Anytime you are using 70% or more of your current limit, your concurrency limit will automatically increase and scale up by 10% every 60 seconds.

As your traffic starts to scale back down and you are using less than 50% of your current limit, your concurrency will start to scale back down until it eventually returns to your default value.
</Tip>

If you exceed your current limit, you'll receive an error with an error message: `Unauthorized connection: Too many concurrent sessions`.

<Note title="Properly terminating sessions">

If you're consistently exceeding the limit of concurrent sessions, first make sure that you're terminating sessions properly.

- If you're using the [WebSocket API](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming-api/streaming-api) directly, you need to send a `terminate_session` message.

</Note>

### LeMUR usage limits

LeMUR requests are rate limited within a 60-second time window. For more information, see [Rate limits](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/overview#rate-limits).

| Usage limit         | Free account | Paid account |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Requests per minute | N/A*         | 30           |

\* LeMUR is only available for paid users.

## Best Practices

- Use different API keys for development and production environments
- Monitor usage and spend patterns for each API key in your dashboard
- Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
- Use meaningful names and tags to easily identify the purpose of each key
- Store API keys as environment variables in your application
