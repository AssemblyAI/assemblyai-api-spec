title: 'Create Multiple API keys'
---

AssemblyAI allows you to create and manage multiple API keys for different projects, teams, or environments. This feature provides enhanced security, better access control, and detailed usage tracking for your API integrations.

## Key Capabilities

- Create and manage API keys for development and production environments with zero downtime
- Track detailed metrics per API key (usage, spend, and concurrency limits)
- Maintain consolidated billing across all API keys

## API Key Limits

Different account tiers have different limits on the number of API keys you can create:

- **Free offering**: Create up to 2 API keys
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Create up to 10 API keys
- **Contracted customers**: Create up to 10 API keys

All tiers benefit from consolidated billing across their API keys.

- Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
- Use meaningful names and tags to easily identify the purpose of each key
- Store API keys as environment variables in your application
