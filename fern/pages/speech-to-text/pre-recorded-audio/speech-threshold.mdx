title: "Speech Threshold"
---

<Note title="Supported Languages, Regions, and Models">
  Speech threshold is supported for all languages, regions, and models.
</Note>

To only transcribe files that contain at least a specified percentage of spoken audio, you can set the `speech_threshold` parameter. You can pass any value between 0 and 1.

If the percentage of speech in the audio file is below the provided threshold, the value of `text` is `None` and the response contains an `error` message:

```plain maxLines=15
Audio speech threshold 0.9461 is below the requested speech threshold value 1.0
```

<Warning>
  A file must contain at least 30 seconds of audio for the amount of spoken
  audio to reliably be determined.
</Warning>
