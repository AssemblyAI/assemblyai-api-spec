Use prompt engineering to control transcription style and improve accuracy for domain-specific terminology. This guide documents best practices for crafting effective prompts for Universal-3-Pro speech transcription.

## How prompting works

Universal-3-Pro is a Speech-augmented Large Language Model (SpeechLLM). The architecture is a multi-modal LLM with an audio encoder and LLM decoder designed to understand and process speech, audio, and text inputs in the same workflow.

SpeechLLM prompting works more like **selecting modes and knobs** than open-ended instruction following. The model is trained primarily to transcribe, then fine-tuned to respond to common transcription instructions for style, speakers, and speech events.

### What prompts can do

| Capability                                  | Description                                                      | Reliability |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Verbatim transcription and disfluencies** | Include um, uh, false starts, repetitions, stutters              | High        |
| **Output style and formatting**             | Control punctuation, capitalization, number formatting           | High        |
| **Context aware clues**                     | Help with jargon, names, and domain expectations                 | Medium      |
| **Entity accuracy and spelling**            | Improve accuracy for proper nouns, brands, technical terms       | Medium      |
| **Speaker attribution**                     | Mark speaker turns and add labels                                | High        |
| **Audio event tags**                        | Mark laughter, music, applause, background sounds                | Medium      |
| **Code-switching and multilingual**         | Handle multilingual audio in same transcript                     | Medium      |
| **Numbers and measurements**                | Control how numbers, percentages, and measurements are formatted | Medium      |
| **Difficult audio handling**                | Guidance for unclear audio, overlapping speech, interruptions    | Medium      |

### What prompts cannot reliably do

| Limitation                    | Why                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invent correct spellings**  | Unknown rare words need hotwords or context injection                  |
| **Resolve ambiguous audio**   | The model transcribes what it hears, not what it infers                |
| **Perfect proper nouns**      | Rare names and entities may need a post-processing LLM correction step |
| **Code-switch and Translate** | Code-switching preserves language or translates, not both              |

For consistent proper-noun accuracy or domain vocabulary, you'll usually need **context injection into the prompt**, use [keyterms prompt](/docs/pre-recorded-audio/improving-transcript-results-with-keyterms-prompting) to highlight known keyterms, or a **post-processing LLM correction step**.

### Example prompts and behavior

**Sample prompt 1: Simple, readable transcription**

```text
Transcribe this audio
```

Characteristics of prompt output:

- Without much instruction, the model follows its training data to transcribe a human readable transcript
- Audio is transcribed as a human would read it, not including disfluencies, false starts, hesitations, and other speech patterns
- No extra weight is given to contextual accuracy of keyterms or in-domain data (i.e. medical), resulting in strong overall WER but higher error rate on rare words

Useful for:

- General transcription
- Readability and sentence structure
- Balanced WER vs contextual accuracy

**Sample prompt 2: Enhanced speech patterns and entity accuracy**

```text
Transcribe accurately with attention to proper nouns, technical terms,
and natural speech patterns.
```

Characteristics of prompt output:

- With more instruction, the model attempts to add contextual correctness to rare words and entities
- Audio is transcribed with more natural speech patterns, including basic disfluencies, false starts, hesitations, and other speech patterns
- Extra weight is given to contextual accuracy of keyterms or in-domain data (i.e. medical), resulting in small degradation of WER for lower error rate on rare words

Useful for:

- In-domain transcription where you know the general context (i.e. medical, legal, finance, technical)
- Basic capture of speech patterns
- Higher WER in exchange for contextual accuracy

**Sample prompt 3: Maximum speech patterns, context, and multilingual accuracy**

```text
Transcribe this audio with beautiful punctuation and formatting.
Include spoken filler words, hesitations, plus repetitions and false starts when clearly spoken.
Use standard spelling and the most contextually correct spelling of all words and names,
brands, drug names, medical terms, person names, and all proper nouns.
Transcribe in the original language mix (code-switching), preserving the words in the language they are spoken.
```

Characteristics of prompt output:

- With many instructions, the model attempts to become as verbatim as possible across a number of different domains - punctuation, formatting, speech patterns, contextual correctness, entity accuracy, and code-switching/multilingual transcription
- Audio is transcribed with as many natural speech patterns as possible, including all potential disfluencies, false starts, hesitations, and other speech patterns
- Because the model is searching for all audio patterns, prompts like this are more likely to also pick up things like cross talk or background noise
- Extra weight is given to contextual accuracy across not just rare words and entities but also mixed languages in the audio

Useful for:

- Maximum capture of speech patterns - will generate the most words transcribed
- Higher WER in exchange for contextual accuracy and multilingual accuracy
- Across a variety of transcripts where you think these different patterns will be encountered

## Prompt capabilities

Each capability below acts as a "knob" you can turn. Combine 3-6 capabilities maximum for best results.

### 1. Verbatim transcription and disfluencies

**What it does:** Preserves natural speech patterns including filler words, false starts, repetitions, and self-corrections.

**Reliability:** High

**Example prompts:**

```text
Include spoken filler words like "um," "uh," "you know," "like," plus repetitions
and false starts when clearly spoken.
```

```text
Preserve all disfluencies exactly as spoken including verbal hesitations,
restarts, and self-corrections (um, uh, I—I mean).
```

```text
Transcribe verbatim:
- Fillers: yes (um, uh, like, you know)
- Repetitions: yes (I I, the the the)
- Stutters: yes (th-that, b-but)
- False starts: yes (I was— I went)
- Colloquial: yes (gonna, wanna, gotta)
```

---

### 2. Output style and formatting

**What it does:** Controls punctuation, capitalization, and readability without changing words.

**Reliability:** High

**Example prompts:**

```text
Transcribe this audio with beautiful punctuation and formatting.
```

```text
Use expressive punctuation to reflect emotion and prosody.
```

```text
Use standard punctuation and sentence breaks for readability.
```

---

### 3. Context aware clues

**What it does:** Helps with jargon, names, and domain expectations that are known from the audio file.

**Reliability:** Medium

**Example prompts:**

```text
Transcribe this audio. Context: a customer testimonial about contact center software.
```

```text
Transcribe this audio. Context: a medical consultation discussing medications and symptoms.
```

```text
Transcribe this audio. Context: a technical lecture about GPUs, CUDA, and inference.
```

---

### 4. Entity accuracy and spelling

**What it does:** Improves accuracy for proper nouns, brands, technical terms, and domain vocabulary.

**Reliability:** Medium

**Example prompts:**

```text
Use standard spelling and the most contextually correct spelling of all words
including names, brands, drug names, medical terms, and proper nouns.
```

```text
Non-negotiable: Pharmaceutical accuracy required across all medications and drug names
```

```text
Preserve acronyms and capitalization of company names and legal entities
```

**Caution:** Over instructing the model to follow specific examples that occur in a file can cause hallucinations when these examples are encountered. We recommend listing the pattern vs the specific error (i.e. `Pharmaceutical accuracy required across all medications and drug names` vs `Pharmaceutical accuracy required (omeprazole over omeprizole, metformin over metforman)`).

---

### 5. Speaker attribution

**What it does:** Marks speaker turns and adds identifying labels.

**Reliability:** High

**Example prompts:**

```text
Mark speaker turns clearly.
```

```text
Tag speaker changes with context like name, role, or gender based on speech content.
```

```text
Label speakers by role when identifiable (Justice Roberts:, Petitioner's Counsel:).
```

Speaker labels can be tagged with names, roles, genders, and more from the audio file. Simply add the desired category for the labels into your prompt.

---

### 6. Audio event tags

**What it does:** Marks non-speech sounds like music, laughter, applause, and background noise.

**Reliability:** Medium

**Example prompts:**

```text
Preserve non-speech audio in tags to indicate when the audio occurred.
```

```text
Tag sounds: [laughter], [silence], [noise], [cough], [sigh].
```

```text
Include audio event markers for music, laughter, and applause.
```

---

### 7. Code-switching and multilingual

**What it does:** Handles audio where speakers switch between languages.

**Reliability:** Medium

**Example prompts:**

```text
Transcribe in the original language mix (code-switching), preserving words
in the language they are spoken.
```

```text
Preserve natural code-switching between English and Spanish. Retain spoken language as-is with mixed language words.
```

**Note:** Requires `language_detection: true` on your request. If a single language code is specified, the model will try to transcribe only that language.

---

### 8. Numbers and measurements

**What it does:** Controls how numbers, percentages, and measurements are formatted.

**Reliability:** Medium

**Example prompts:**

```text
Convert spoken numbers to digits.
```

```text
Use digits for numbers, percentages, and measurements.
```

```text
Format financial figures with standard notation and format numbers for maximum readability.
```

---

### 9. Difficult audio handling

**What it does:** Provides guidance for unclear audio, overlapping speech, and interruptions.

**Reliability:** Medium (YMMV)

**Example prompts:**

```text
If unintelligible, write (unclear).
```

```text
Mark inaudible segments. Preserve overlapping speech and crosstalk.
```

```text
Include pause markers where the speaker hesitates significantly.
```

| **3-6 instructions maximum**     | Massive | `Transcribe verbatim. Include all disfluencies. Pay attention to rare words and entities. Preserve natural speech patterns.` | Prevents conflicting instructions                                                    |
| **Desired output format**        | High    | `Pharmaceutical accuracy required across all medications and drug names`                                                     | Model learns the domain context and entities to pay closer attention to transcribing |
| **Explicit disfluency examples** | High    | `Include all disfluencies (um, uh, like, you know)`                                                                          | Model sees the speech patterns and linguistic cues to pay extra attention to         |

### What hurts

| Anti-pattern                                  | Impact                   | Example                                                                                   | Why it hurts                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explicit examples of errors from the file** | Potential Hallucinations | `Pharmaceutical accuracy required (omeprazole over omeprizole, metformin over metforman)` | Model is over eager to correct exact phrases in the transcript                                                |
| **Negative language**                         | Severe                   | `Don't`, `Avoid`, `Never`, `Not`                                                          | Model does not process negative instructions and gets confused                                                |
| **Conflicting instructions**                  | Severe                   | `Include disfluencies. Maximum readability`                                               | Model has to make a decision which instruction to process leading to less determinate results                 |
| **Short, vague instructions**                 | High                     | `Be accurate`, `Best transcript ever`, `Superhero human transcriptionist`                 | Model doesn't understand the instruction pattern to identify, pay attention to, and correct                   |
| **Missing disfluency instructions**           | Medium                   | `Transcribe verbatim`, `Transcribe this audio`                                            | Not necessarily a failure but the model by default will not be expressive with disfluencies unless instructed |

## Domain-specific sample prompts

### Legal transcription

Best for: Court proceedings, depositions, legal hearings

```text
Mandatory: Transcribe legal proceedings with precise terminology intact.

Required: Preserve all disfluencies including verbal pauses, false starts, and
self-corrections (uh, um, I—I mean over cleaned speech).

Non-negotiable: Distinguish between speakers through clear attribution
(Justice Roberts: over generic labels).

Capture Latin legal phrases exactly as spoken (certiorari, habeas corpus,
amicus curiae).
```

**Why it works:** Combines authoritative language (Mandatory, Required, Non-negotiable), explicit disfluency examples with contrast format, speaker attribution guidance, and domain terminology.

---

### Medical transcription

Best for: Clinical documentation, medical dictation, patient-provider conversations

```text
Mandatory: Preserve all clinical terminology exactly as spoken including drug names, dosages, and diagnostic terms.

Required: Capture every hesitation, false start, and filler word (um, uh, ah) as spoken.

Label physician and patient speech clearly when identifiable.
```

**Why it works:** Combines authoritative language (Mandatory, Required) with explicit disfluency examples, while ensuring clinical terminology accuracy and clear speaker attribution for medical documentation.

---

### Financial/Earnings calls

Best for: Quarterly earnings calls, investor presentations, financial meetings

```text
Mandatory: Corporate earnings call transcription with precise financial
terminology.

Required: Preserve all speaker disfluencies including hesitations, false starts,
and filler words (um, uh, you know) exactly as spoken.

Non-negotiable: Financial term accuracy (EBITDA over ebitda, year-over-year
over y-o-y, basis points over bps).

Format numerical data with standard notation. Label executive speakers by role
when identifiable (CEO:, CFO:, Analyst:).
```

**Why it works:** Balances financial terminology precision with verbatim capture of executive speech patterns important for tone analysis.

---

### Software/Technical meetings

Best for: Engineering standups, code reviews, technical discussions

```text
Mandatory: Technical meeting transcription with multiple participants.

Required: Preserve all verbal disfluencies including hesitations, false starts,
and thinking sounds (um, uh, hmm, so) exactly as spoken.

Non-negotiable: Technical terminology accuracy (Kubernetes over kubernetties,
PostgreSQL over postgres, API over A.P.I.).

Mark speaker transitions explicitly. Capture self-corrections and restarts
(I was— I went, th-that).
```

**Why it works:** Preserves natural developer speech patterns while ensuring technical terms are spelled correctly.

---

### Code-switching (Bilingual)

Best for: Multilingual conversations, Spanglish, language mixing

```text
Mandatory: Transcribe verbatim, preserving natural code-switching between
English and Spanish.

Required: Retain spoken language as-is without translation
(correct "I was hablando con mi manager").

Non-negotiable: Preserve fillers, repetitions, and false starts across both
languages (eh, o sea— I mean, you know).

Resolve sound-alike errors using bilingual context (pero over perro,
meeting over mitin).
```

**Why it works:** Explicitly instructs preservation over translation, handles cross-language disfluencies, and addresses common bilingual transcription errors.

---

### Customer support call

Best for: Contact center calls, customer service interactions, agent-customer conversations

```text
Customer support call between agent and customer.

Mandatory: Transcribe any overlapping speech across channels including crosstalk.

Required: Pay attention to proper nouns like names, balance amounts, and bank name
being correct.

Non-negotiable: Preserve all disfluencies exactly as spoken including verbal
hesitations, restarts, and self-corrections (um, uh, I—I mean).
```

**Why it works:** Combines multichannel awareness for overlapping speech with entity accuracy for critical customer data (names, amounts, institutions), while preserving verbatim speech patterns essential for quality assurance and compliance review.

## How to build your prompt

### Step 1: Start with your base need

Choose your primary transcription goal:

| Goal                        | Base instruction                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Verbatim/disfluencies**   | `Include spoken filler words, hesitations, plus repetitions and false starts when clearly spoken.` |
| **Output style/formatting** | `Transcribe this audio with beautiful punctuation and formatting.`                                 |
| **Context aware clues**     | `Transcribe this audio. Context: [describe the audio content and domain].`                         |
| **Entity accuracy**         | `Use standard spelling and contextually correct spelling of all proper nouns.`                     |
| **Speaker attribution**     | `Mark speaker turns clearly. Tag speaker changes with context like name, role, or gender.`         |
| **Audio event tags**        | `Preserve non-speech audio in tags to indicate when the audio occurred.`                           |
| **Code-switching**          | `Transcribe in the original language mix, preserving words in the language spoken.`                |
| **Numbers/measurements**    | `Use digits for numbers, percentages, and measurements.`                                           |
| **Difficult audio**         | `If unintelligible, write (unclear). Mark inaudible segments.`                                     |

### Step 2: Add authoritative language

Prefix each instruction with:

- `Non-negotiable:`
- `Mandatory:`
- `Required:`
- `Strict requirement:`

### Step 3: Add instructions one by one

We recommend you layer on each instruction one by one to see the impact on the transcription output. Since conflicting instructions can cause outputs to degrade, adding each instruction one by one allows you to test and evaluate how each instruction improves/degrades your transcription output.

### Step 4: Iterate and test

1. **Identify target terms** - What words/phrases are being transcribed incorrectly?
2. **Find the error pattern** - Vowel substitution? Sound-alike? Phonetic spelling?
3. **Choose example terms** - Pick 2-3 common terms with the SAME error pattern
4. **Test and verify** - Listen to the audio to confirm correctness
5. **Measure success rate** - Test variations on sample files

### Final prompt structure

```text
[Authoritative language]: [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
[Authoritative language]: [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
[Authoritative language]: [Specific instruction] + [Explicit examples]
```
