<Tip title="Looking to improve transcription accuracy?">
  For significantly better results, try our new approach using [LeMUR Custom
  Vocabulary](/docs/guides/custom-vocab-lemur). This advanced method provides
  more precise recognition for domain-specific terms and proper nouns without
  the formatting limitations of traditional word boosting.
</Tip>

To improve the transcription accuracy, you can boost certain words or phrases that appear frequently in your audio file.

To boost words or phrases, include the `word_boost` parameter in the transcription config.

You can also control how much weight to apply to each keyword or phrase. Include `boost_param` in the transcription config with a value of `low`, `default`, or `high`.

<Note>
Follow formatting guidelines for custom vocabulary to ensure the best results:

- Remove all punctuation except apostrophes.
- Make sure each word is in its spoken form. For example, `iphone seven` instead of `iphone 7`.
- Remove spaces between letters in acronyms.

Additionally, the model still accepts words with unique characters such as é, but converts them to their ASCII equivalent.

You can boost a maximum of 1,000 unique keywords and phrases, where each of them can contain up to 6 words.
