title: "Transcript Status"
---

After you've submitted a file for transcription, your transcript has one of the following statuses:

| Status       | Description                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `processing` | The audio file is being processed.                 |
| `queued`     | The audio file is waiting to be processed.         |
| `completed`  | The transcription has completed successfully.      |
| `error`      | An error occurred while processing the audio file. |

## Handling errors

If the transcription fails, the status of the transcript is `error`, and the transcript includes an `error` property explaining what went wrong.

<Note>
A transcription may fail for various reasons:

- Unsupported file format
- Missing audio in file
- Unreachable audio URL

If a transcription fails due to a server error, we recommend that you resubmit the file for transcription to allow another server to process the audio.
