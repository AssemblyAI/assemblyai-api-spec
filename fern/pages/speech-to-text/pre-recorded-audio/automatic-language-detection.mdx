Identify the dominant language spoken in an audio file and use it during the transcription. Enable it to detect any of the [supported languages](/docs/pre-recorded-audio/set-language-manually#supported-languages).

<Warning>
  To reliably identify the dominant language, a file must contain **at least 15
  seconds** of spoken audio. Results will be improved if there is at least 15-90
  seconds of spoken audio in the file.

## Set a list of expected languages

If you're confident the audio is in one of a few languages, provide that list via `language_detection_options.expected_languages`. Detection is restricted to these candidates and the model will choose the language with the highest confidence from this list. This can eliminate scenarios where Automatic Language Detection selects an unexpected language for transcription.

- Use our [language codes](/docs/pre-recorded-audio/set-language-manually#supported-languages) (e.g., `"en"`, `"es"`, `"fr"`).
- If `expected_languages` is not specified, it is set to `["all"]` by default.

## Choose a fallback language

Control what language transcription should fall back to when detection cannot confidently select a language from the `expected_languages` list.

- Set `language_detection_options.fallback_language` to a specific language code (e.g., `"en"`).
- `fallback_language` must be one of the language codes in `expected_languages` or `"auto"`.
- When `fallback_language` is unspecified, it is set to `"auto"` by default. This tells our model to choose the fallback language from `expected_languages` with the highest confidence score.

## Confidence score

If language detection is enabled, the API returns a confidence score for the detected language. The score ranges from 0.0 (low confidence) to 1.0 (high confidence).

## Set a language confidence threshold

You can set the confidence threshold that must be reached if language detection is enabled. An error will be returned
if the language confidence is below this threshold. Valid values are in the range [0,1] inclusive.

<Note>
  If the `language_confidence_threshold` you specify is not met you will receive
  an error message like `detected language 'bg', confidence 0.2949, is below the
  requested confidence threshold value of '0.4'`.
