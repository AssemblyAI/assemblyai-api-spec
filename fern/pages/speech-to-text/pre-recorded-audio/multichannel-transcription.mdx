title: "Multichannel Transcription"
---

<Note title="Supported Languages, Regions, and Models">
  Multichannel transcription is supported for all languages, regions, and
  models.
</Note>

If you have a multichannel audio file with multiple speakers, you can transcribe each of them separately.

The response includes an `audio_channels` property with the number of different channels, and an additional `utterances` property, containing a list of turn-by-turn utterances.

Each utterance contains channel information, starting at 1.

Additionally, each word in the `words` array contains the channel identifier.

<Note>
  Multichannel audio increases the transcription time by approximately 25%.

## Per-channel diarization

If you have a multichannel audio file where individual channels may contain multiple speakers, you can combine `multichannel` and `speaker_labels` to perform diarization within each channel.

When both parameters are enabled:

- Channels are labeled numerically (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Speakers within each channel are labeled alphabetically (A, B, C, etc.)
- The combined speaker label format is `{channel}{speaker}` (e.g., "1A", "1B", "2A")

For example, if channel 1 has two speakers and channel 2 has one speaker, the labels would be:

- First speaker on channel 1: `1A`
- Second speaker on channel 1: `1B`
- First speaker on channel 2: `2A`
