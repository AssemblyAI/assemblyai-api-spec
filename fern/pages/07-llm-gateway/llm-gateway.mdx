## Overview

**AssemblyAI's LLM Gateway** is a unified interface that allows you to connect with multiple LLM providers including Claude, GPT, and Gemini. You can use the LLM Gateway to build sophisticated AI applications through a single API.

The LLM Gateway provides access to 15+ models across major AI providers with support for:
- **Basic Chat Completions** - Simple request/response interactions
- **Tool/Function Calling** - Enable models to execute custom functions
- **Agentic Workflows** - Multi-step reasoning with automatic tool chaining
- **Multi-turn Conversations** - Maintain context across multiple exchanges
- **Unified Interface** - One API for Claude, GPT, Gemini, and more

## Getting Started

### Basic Chat Completion

Send a message and receive a response:

```python
import requests

headers = {
  "authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    headers = headers,
    json = {
        "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
        ],
        "max_tokens": 1000
    }
)

result = response.json()
print(result["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

### Multi-turn Conversations

Maintain context by including conversation history:

```python
import requests

headers = {
  "authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}

conversation_history = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The capital of France is Paris."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the population?"}
]

response = requests.post(
    "https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    headers = headers,
    json = {
        "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
        "messages": conversation_history,
        "max_tokens": 1000
    }
)
```

## Tool Calling

### Defining Tools

Define functions the model can call to access external data or functionality:

```python
import requests

headers = {
  "authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}

tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "search_employees",
            "description": "Search employee database by name, department, or other criteria",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "first_name": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "Employee's first name"
                    },
                    "department": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "Department name"
                    }
                },
                "required": []
            }
        }
    }
]

response = requests.post(
    "https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    headers = headers,
    json={
        "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Find employees in Engineering"}],
        "tools": tools
    }
)
```

### Handling Tool Calls

Execute tools and send results back to continue the conversation:

```python
import requests
import json

headers = {
  "authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}

choice = response.json()["choices"][0]

if choice.get("tool_calls"):
    tool_call = choice["tool_calls"][0]

    # Add function call to history
    conversation_history.append({
        "type": "function_call",
        "tool_call_id": tool_call["id"],
        "name": tool_call["function"]["name"],
        "arguments": tool_call["function"]["arguments"]
    })

    # Execute your function
    result = execute_function(
        tool_call["function"]["name"],
        json.loads(tool_call["function"]["arguments"])
    )

    # Add function output to history
    conversation_history.append({
        "type": "function_call_output",
        "tool_call_id": tool_call["id"],
        "name": tool_call["function"]["name"],
        "output": json.dumps({"result": result})
    })

    # Continue conversation with the result
    response = requests.post(
        "https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1/chat/completions",
        headers = headers,
        json = {
            "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
            "messages": conversation_history,
            "tools": tools
        }
    )
```

### Tool Call Flow

The complete tool calling process:

1. Send user message with `tools` array defining available functions
2. Model responds with `tool_calls` if it needs to use a tool
3. Execute the tool in your application code
4. Add `function_call` and `function_call_output` to conversation history
5. Send updated history back to the API
6. Model incorporates results and either calls more tools or provides final answer

## Agentic Workflows

Enable the model to make multiple sequential tool calls for complex multi-step reasoning:

```python
import requests

headers = {
  "authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}

conversation_history = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Where does Sarah work and what city is that in?"}
]

max_iterations = 10
iteration = 0

while iteration < max_iterations:
    iteration += 1
    response = chat(conversation_history, model)
    choice = response["choices"][0]

    if choice.get("tool_calls"):
        # Execute tools and add results to history
        handle_tool_calls(choice["tool_calls"], conversation_history)
        # Continue loop - model can make more tool calls
        continue
    else:
        # Model has final answer
        print(choice["message"]["content"])
        break
```

### Example Interaction

```
You: Where does Andrew live?
ðŸ”§ Calling: search_employees(first_name="Andrew")
âœ… Result: Found 1 result
ðŸ”§ Calling: search_tavily(query="33186 zip code location")
âœ… Result: The zip code 33186 is located in Miami, Florida...
Assistant: Andrew lives in Miami, Florida (zip code 33186).
```

### How Agentic Behavior Works

The model autonomously:

- Decides which tools to use based on the question
- Chains multiple tools together (e.g., get employee info â†’ lookup location details)
- Iterates until it has sufficient information to answer
- Handles complex multi-step reasoning automatically

This is achieved by running a loop that continues making requests as long as the model is calling tools.

## Reference

### Message Types

- **user** - Messages from the user
- **assistant** - Messages from the AI model
- **system** - System instructions or context
- **function_call** - Records a tool being called by the model
- **function_call_output** - Records the result of executing a tool

### Message Roles

When using tools, structure your conversation history with these message types to track the complete interaction flow between the user, model, and tool executions.

<Note>
    The LLM Gateway API is separate from the Speech-to-Text and Audio Intelligence APIs. It provides a unified interface to work with large language models across multiple providers.
