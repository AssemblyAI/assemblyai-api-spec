## Overview

**AssemblyAI's LLM Gateway** is a unified interface that allows you to connect with multiple LLM providers including Claude, GPT, and Gemini. You can use the LLM Gateway to build sophisticated AI applications through a single API.

The LLM Gateway provides access to 15+ models across major AI providers with support for:
- **Basic Chat Completions** - Simple request/response interactions
- **Multi-turn Conversations** - Maintain context across multiple exchanges
- **Tool/Function Calling** - Enable models to execute custom functions
- **Agentic Workflows** - Multi-step reasoning with automatic tool chaining
- **Unified Interface** - One API for Claude, GPT, Gemini, and more
