## Overview

Speaker Identification allows you to identify speakers by their actual names or roles, transforming generic labels like "Speaker A" or "Speaker B" into meaningful identifiers that you provide. Speaker identities are inferred based on the conversation content.

**Example transformation:**

**Before:**

```txt
Speaker A: Good morning, and welcome to the show.
Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
Speaker A: Let's dive into today's topic...
```

**After:**

```txt
Michel Martin: Good morning, and welcome to the show.
Peter DeCarlo: Thanks for having me.
Michel Martin: Let's dive into today's topic...
```

<Note>
  Speaker Identification requires that a file be transcribed with Speaker Diarization enabled. See [this section](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization) of our documentation to learn more about the Speaker Diarization feature.

To reliably identify speakers, your audio should contain clear, distinguishable voices and sufficient spoken audio from each speaker. The accuracy of Speaker Diarization depends on the quality of the audio and the distinctiveness of each speaker's voice, which will have a downstream effect on the quality of Speaker Identification.

</Note>

## How to use Speaker Identification

There are two ways to use Speaker Identification:

1. **Transcribe and identify in one request** - Best when you're starting a new transcription and want speaker identification included automatically
2. **Transcribe and identify in separate requests** - Best when you already have a completed transcript or for more complex workflows where you might want to perform other tasks between the transcription and speaker identification process

### Method 1: Transcribe and identify in one request

This method is ideal when you're starting fresh and want both transcription and speaker identification in a single workflow.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<Tab language="python" title="Python" default>
<Code src="snippets/speech-understanding/speech-understanding/python-1.py" />
**After (with Speaker Identification):**

```txt wordWrap
Michel Martin: ... We wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we called Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Good morning, Professor.
Peter DeCarlo: Good morning.
Michel Martin: So what is it about the conditions right now that have caused this round of wildfires to affect so many people so far away?
Peter DeCarlo: Well, there's a couple of things. The season has been pretty dry already, and then the fact that we're getting hit in the US is because there's a couple weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires through Pennsylvania into the mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of just dropping the smoke there.
```

## Advanced usage

### Identifying speakers by role

Instead of identifying speakers by name as shown in the examples above, you can also identify speakers by role.

This can be useful in customer service calls, AI interactions, or any scenario where you may not know the specific names of the speakers but still want to identify them by something more than a generic identifier like A, B, or C.

To identify speakers by role, use the `speaker_type` parameter with a value of "role":

#### Example

<Code src="snippets/speech-understanding/speech-understanding/python-2.py" />
#### Common role combinations

- `["Agent", "Customer"]` - Customer service calls
- `["AI Assistant", "User"]` - AI chatbot interactions
- `["Support", "Customer"]` - Technical support calls
- `["Interviewer", "Interviewee"]` - Interview recordings
- `["Host", "Guest"]` - Podcast or show recordings
- `["Moderator", "Panelist"]` - Panel discussions

## API reference

### Request

#### Method 1: Transcribe and identify in one request

When creating a new transcription, include the `speech_understanding` parameter directly in your transcription request:

<Code src="snippets/speech-understanding/speech-understanding/bash-1.sh" />
#### Method 2: Add identification to existing transcripts

For existing transcripts, retrieve the completed transcript and send it to the Speech Understanding API:

<Code
  src="snippets/speech-understanding/speech-understanding/bash-2.sh"
  highlight={[6]}
  maxLines={15}
/>
