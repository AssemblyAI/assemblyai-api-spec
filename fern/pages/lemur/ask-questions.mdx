## Basic Q&A example

To ask a question about your audio transcript, define a prompt with your questions and send it to LLM Gateway along with the transcript text using the chat completions API.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<Tab language="python" title="Python" default>

<Code src="../../snippets/lemur/ask-questions/python-1.py" highlight={[42-43,45-53]} />
</Tab>
<Tab language="javascript" title="JavaScript">
  
<Code src="../../snippets/lemur/ask-questions/javascript-1.js" highlight={[44-45,47-52]} />
</Tab>
<Tab language="php" title="PHP">

<Code src="../../snippets/lemur/ask-questions/php.php" highlight={[57-58,60-73]} />
</Tab>
