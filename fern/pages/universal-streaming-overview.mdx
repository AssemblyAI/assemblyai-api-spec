title: Universal Streaming
---

The Universal Streaming Speech-to-Text service is AssemblyAI's next-generation streaming API that leverages [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API). This service provides ultra-low latency transcription with advanced features like turn detection and word-level finalization tracking.

This section details the endpoints and procedures necessary for utilizing the universal streaming functionality, including:

- [POST endpoint](/docs/api-reference/universal-streaming/create-temporary-token) to obtain a temporary token for authentication
- [WebSockets API reference](/docs/api-reference/universal-streaming/realtime) with detailed information on managing WebSocket connections for streaming

## Key features

- **Ultra-low latency**: Optimized for real-time applications and voice agents
- **Turn detection**: Automatic detection of speaker turns with confidence scores
- **Word finalization tracking**: Know exactly when words are finalized
- **Mid-stream configuration**: Update configuration parameters during an active session
- **Formatted transcripts**: Optional punctuation and capitalization

## Close and error codes

The WebSocket specification provides [standard errors](https://github.com/Luka967/websocket-close-codes). Additionally, the API returns application-level errors for well-known scenarios:

| Error Condition                              | Status Code | Message                                                                                                                                          |

## Limits

- **Idle Sessions** - Sessions that don't receive audio within 1 minute will be terminated.
- **Session Limit** - 100 sessions at a time for paid users. Please contact us if you need to increase this limit. Free-tier users must upgrade their account to use real-time streaming.
- **Session Uniqueness** - Only one WebSocket per session.
- **Audio Sampling Rate Limit** - Customers must send data in near real-time. If a client sends data faster than 1 second of audio per second for longer than 1 minute, we'll terminate the session.
