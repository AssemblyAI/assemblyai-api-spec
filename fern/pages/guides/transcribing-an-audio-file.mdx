In this guide, we'll show you how to use the API to transcribe your audio files.

You can also learn the content on this page from [How to Transcribe Audio Files with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTWM5WuPhlQ) on [AssemblyAI's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AssemblyAI).

<Tip>

If you're using Python or JavaScript, see [Transcribe an audio file](/docs/getting-started/transcribe-an-audio-file).

</Tip>

## Get started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

The entire source code of this guide can be viewed [here](https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Community/docs-snippets/tree/main/transcribing).

Most of these libraries are included by default, but on .NET Framework and Mono you need to reference the System.Net.Http library and install the [System.Net.Http.Json NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Net.Http.Json).

AssemblyAI transcribes your audio file asynchronously. Once the status is `completed`, you can retrieve the transcript. Create a method that polls the status every 3 seconds and returns the transcript when it's ready.

After making the request, you'll receive an ID for the transcription. Use it to poll the API every few seconds to check the status of the transcript job. Once the status is `completed`, you can retrieve the transcript from the API response.

## Understanding the response

The AssemblyAI API returns JSON-formatted output. Your transcription will be located in the `text` key. You'll also find a timestamp and a confidence score for each word inside of the `words` key, as well as other parameters assigned by the API such as `language_code` and `language_model`.

<EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="GET /v2/transcript/{transcript_id}" />

Refer to the [API reference](https://assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/transcripts/get#response) for a breakdown of every element in your transcript output.

## Best practices

When using the AssemblyAI API to transcribe audio files, we recommended using the polling technique to check for the status of the transcription. This means making a request every few seconds to check if the transcription is complete, as described above.

Alternatively, you can also set up [webhooks](/docs/getting-started/webhooks) to receive notifications when the transcription is complete. This can help reduce the overhead of polling and make your application more efficient.

## Conclusion

Transcription is our core API use case, and nearly all other AssemblyAI features leverage our transcription functionality. We're constantly improving and updating the [language models](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/releasing-our-new-v9-transcription-model-11-better-accuracy/) used by our [transcription engine](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/conformer-2/). Of course, higher quality audio generally produces better results.
