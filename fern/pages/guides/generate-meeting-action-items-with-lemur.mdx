In this guide, you'll learn how to use AssemblyAI [LeMUR](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur/task) to process an audio file and then automatically generate action items from the meeting's transcript.

## Overview

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard.

LeMUR features are currently only available to paid users at two pricing tiers, LeMUR Default and LeMUR Basic. Refer to our [pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing) for more detail.

## Step-by-step instructions

In this guide, you'll use AssemblyAI to transcribe a meeting recording. Then, you'll request a list of action items from LeMUR.
