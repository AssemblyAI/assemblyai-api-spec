This guide explains how to track individual customer usage within your product for billing purposes.

<Note>
  This is the recommended approach for tracking customer usage. Creating
  separate API keys for each of your customers is not an optimal strategy for
  usage tracking, as it adds unnecessary complexity and makes it harder to
  manage your account.
</Note>

There are two separate methods depending on which transcription approach you use:

1. **Async transcription**: Use webhooks with custom query parameters to associate transcriptions with customers, then retrieve the `audio_duration` from the transcript response.

2. **Streaming transcription**: Manage customer IDs in your application state and capture the `session_duration_seconds` from the WebSocket Termination event.

This guide covers both methods in detail.

## Async transcription usage tracking

By combining webhooks with custom metadata, you can track audio duration per customer and monitor their usage of your transcription service.

### Step 1: Set up webhooks with customer metadata

When submitting a transcription request, include your webhook URL with the customer ID as a query parameter. This allows you to associate each transcription with a specific customer.

You can add multiple query parameters to track additional information:

```
https://your-domain.com/webhook?customer_id=123&project_id=456&order_id=789
```

This allows you to track usage across multiple dimensions (customer, project, order, etc.).

### Step 2: Handle the webhook delivery

When the transcription completes, AssemblyAI sends a POST request to your webhook URL with the following payload:

```json
{
  "transcript_id": "5552493-16d8-42d8-8feb-c2a16b56f6e8",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

Extract both the `transcript_id` from the payload and the `customer_id` from your URL query parameters.

### Step 3: Retrieve the transcript with audio duration

Use the transcript ID to fetch the complete transcript details, which includes the `audio_duration` field (in seconds).

### Step 4: Track usage per customer

In your webhook handler, combine the customer ID from your webhook URL query parameters with the audio duration from the transcript to record usage:

1. Extract the `customer_id` from the webhook URL query parameters
2. Extract the `transcript_id` from the webhook payload
3. If the status is `completed`, fetch the transcript using the SDK to get the `audio_duration`
4. Store the usage record in your database with the customer ID, transcript ID, audio duration, and timestamp

This allows you to aggregate usage per customer for billing purposes.

## Streaming transcription usage tracking

Unlike async transcription which uses webhooks, streaming transcription requires a different approach. You'll track usage by managing customer IDs in your own application state/session management, capturing the `session_duration_seconds` from the Termination event, and associating the duration with the customer ID for billing/tracking. AssemblyAI bills streaming based on session duration, so this is the metric you should track.

### Step 1: Set up your WebSocket connection

Connect to AssemblyAI's streaming service. The customer ID is managed entirely in your application and is never sent to AssemblyAI.

<Code src="snippets/guides/billing-tracking/python-3.py" />
### Step 2: Capture audio duration from the Termination event

The key to tracking usage is capturing the `audio_duration_seconds` field from the Termination message. This is sent when the streaming session ends.

<Code src="snippets/guides/billing-tracking/python-4.py" />
### Step 3: Log customer usage

When you receive the Termination event, store the session duration for billing/tracking:

1. Retrieve the customer ID from your session management system (authentication tokens, session cookies, etc.)
2. Extract the `session_duration_seconds` from the Termination event
3. Store the usage record in your database with the customer ID, session duration, and timestamp

Since AssemblyAI bills streaming based on `session_duration_seconds`, this is the metric you should track for accurate billing.

### Session duration vs audio duration

From the Termination event, you receive two fields:

| Field                      | Description                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `session_duration_seconds` | Total time the session was open           |
| `audio_duration_seconds`   | Total seconds of audio actually processed |

<Note>
  Streaming transcription is billed based on `session_duration_seconds`, not
  `audio_duration_seconds`. Make sure you track the correct metric for accurate
  billing.
</Note>

### Session management

You need to implement your own session management to associate WebSocket connections with customer IDs. This could be through user authentication tokens, session cookies, database lookups, or in-memory session stores. Track the customer ID throughout the WebSocket lifecycle so you can associate it with the session duration when the Termination event arrives.

### Proper session termination

Always close sessions properly to ensure you receive the Termination event and avoid unexpected costs:

```python
# Send termination message when done
terminate_message = {"type": "Terminate"}
ws.send(json.dumps(terminate_message))
```

## Best practices

When implementing billing tracking, consider the following best practices:

1. **Store the transcript/session ID**: Always store the identifier alongside usage records. This allows you to audit and verify billing data.

2. **Handle errors gracefully**: If a transcription fails (`status: "error"`), don't bill the customer for that request. You may want to log failed transcriptions for debugging.

3. **Secure your webhooks**: Use the `webhook_auth_header_name` and `webhook_auth_header_value` parameters to verify that webhook requests are from AssemblyAI.

4. **Consider time zones**: Store timestamps in UTC to avoid confusion when generating billing reports.
