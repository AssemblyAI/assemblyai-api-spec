title: "Identify Speaker Names From the Transcript Using LeMUR"
---

In this guide, you'll learn how to use AssemblyAI's API to transcribe audio, identify speakers, and infer their names using LeMUR. We'll walk through the process of configuring the transcriber, submitting a transcript to LeMUR with speaker labels, and generating a mapping of speaker names from the transcript.

This workflow will enable you to have speaker labels with the speaker's name in your transcripts instead of `Speaker A/B`.

## Before you begin

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
- An upgraded [AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup).

```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` and `re` packages and set your API key:

```python
import assemblyai as aai
import re

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR-API-KEY"
```

Define a `Transcriber`, a `TranscriptionConfig` with `speaker_labels` set to `True`. Then, create a transcript.

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/speaker-identification/python-1.py" />
Process the transcript with speaker labels:

```python
text_with_speaker_labels = ""

for utt in transcript.utterances:
    text_with_speaker_labels += f"Speaker {utt.speaker}:\n{utt.text}\n"
```

Count the unique speakers, then create a `LemurQuestion` for each speaker. Lastly, ask LeMUR the questions, specifying `text_with_speaker_labels` as the `input_text`.

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/speaker-identification/python-2.py" />
Map the speaker alphabets to their names from LeMUR:

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/speaker-identification/python-3.py" />
Print the Transcript with Speaker Names:

```python
for utterance in transcript.utterances[:10]:
   speaker_name = speaker_mapping[utterance.speaker]
   print(f"{speaker_name}: {utterance.text[:50]}...")
```
