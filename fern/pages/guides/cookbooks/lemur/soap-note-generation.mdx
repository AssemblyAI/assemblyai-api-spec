title: "Generate SOAP Notes using LLM Gateway"
---

The acronym SOAP stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. This standardized method of documenting patient encounters allows providers to concisely record patient information. This guide walks through how to generate SOAP notes with AssemblyAI's LLM Gateway, which provides access to multiple LLM providers through a unified API.

## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard. You will need to upgrade your account by adding a credit card to have access to LLM Gateway.

Find more details on the current pricing in the AssemblyAI [pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Set up your transcription with PII redaction enabled to protect patient information:

## Two different methods of generating SOAP notes

### Method 1: Complete SOAP Note Generation

This method uses LLM Gateway to generate the entire SOAP note in one request. The prompt includes context about the audio file, a specific format for the SOAP note, and detailed instructions for each section.

### Method 2: Section-by-Section Generation

This method generates each section of the SOAP note separately using LLM Gateway. This makes it easy to regenerate one or more sections individually if needed. Each section is generated with a specific prompt tailored to that part of the SOAP note.
