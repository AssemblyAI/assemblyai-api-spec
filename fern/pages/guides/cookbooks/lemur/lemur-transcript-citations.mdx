title: "Generate Transcript Citations using LeMUR"

This guide will walk through the process of generating transcript citations using OpenAI embeddings and the LeMUR API.

## Overview

Extracting exact quotes from transcripts can be a difficult task for Large Language Models, which makes it challenging to cite sources or identify timestamps for generative text.

Embeddings are powerful representations of text that capture its semantic and contextual meaning. By leveraging embeddings, we can transform raw text data, such as transcripts, into dense numerical vectors that encode its underlying information. These embeddings enable us to perform sophisticated tasks such as similarity comparison and contextual searching.

In this guide, we demonstrate how to utilize OpenAI embeddings to retrieve transcript citations to corroborate the results from the LeMUR API. LeMUR is proficient at providing the 'what' & 'why' and now embeddings will be able to provide the 'where' & 'when'.

We'll walk through 3 use cases for this including verification of sources for specific answers, timestamping of action items, and generation of customer quotes.

## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for an account and get your API key from your dashboard. You will also need an [OpenAI API token](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart).

LeMUR features are currently only available to paid users. See [pricing](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing) for more details.

## Instructions

Install the libraries required for the transcription and embedding creation.

```bash
pip install numpy sklearn openai assemblyai tiktoken
```

### Submitting a File for Transcription

### Create Transcript Embeddings

We are using the text-embedding-ada-002 model to generate our embeddings.

The pricing for this model is $0.0001 / 1k tokens which equates to roughly 0.0015 to embed one hour of audio.

## Examples

### Cite Answers to Specific Questions

Cite your sources to specific answers returned from the LeMUR Q&A API.

```python
questions = [
    aai.LemurQuestion(question="how does calcium relate to adheren junctions?", context='', answer_format="")
]
```

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/lemur-transcript-citations/python-5.py" />
<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/lemur-transcript-citations/python-6.py" />
Example output:

```
Question: how does calcium relate to adheren junctions?
Answer: Adheren junctions are calcium dependent, meaning that if calcium is removed, the cells will fall apart as the junctions disassemble.

CITATIONS:
#1
QUOTE: "If you were to put in some kind of calcium chelator like EDTA that removed the calcium from the media or the extracellular fluid in these cells, these cells would actually fall apart and these junctions would fall apart. On the cytoplasmic side, you have a number of linker proteins. Again, they've been named in this diagram, catinin Vinculin and Alpha Actinin are involved, and again, they link up to the actin filaments."

#2
QUOTE: "If you have two cells that are attached to one another and they're undergoing physical forces, what keeps them from coming apart is these adhering junctions. There are forces you can imagine in your intestine that would rub against the epithelia as material passes through. And these adhering junctions keep those epithelia from coming apart and exposing the connected tissue below. Gap junctions are found in most cells and their real function is actually as a pore or channel that lies between two adjacent cells. And these allow for small molecules to pass ions to pass through and they're controlled pores."

#3
QUOTE: "And we take a look at a schematic showing the intracellular surface of one cell and the intracellular surface of another. Here are the plasma membranes of one and cell two, and then the space in between. The space is about 20. Unlike the cludence junction, there is a space, and that space contains transmembrane proteins called caherons, which match up with their homolog on the adjacent cell, and they hold the two cells together. These adherence junctions are calcium dependent."

### Provide References to Multiple Transcripts

When analyzing multiple transcripts, it can be helpful to have references to know which transcript the answer came from.
