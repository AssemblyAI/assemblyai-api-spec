title: "Create Chapter Summaries Using LLM Gateway"
---

In this guide, we'll show you how to use AssemblyAI's LLM Gateway to process an audio file and summarize it into chapters using paragraph data from the transcription.

<Note>
  This guide shows how to use paragraph data from transcriptions to create
  chapter summaries. You can customize the paragraph grouping and prompts to fit
  your specific use case for creating structured summaries.
</Note>

## Quickstart

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/input-text-chapters/python-1.py" />
## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for an account and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Set up your API client and transcribe the audio file:

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/input-text-chapters/python-2.py" />
Fetch all paragraphs from the transcript and combine them into groups. We set a
`step` variable that controls how many paragraphs we combine into one overall
paragraph to provide LLM Gateway with more context to create better summaries.

We also extract the appropriate `start` and `end` timestamps, and save all of our combined paragraphs in string form to send to LLM Gateway in a later step.

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/input-text-chapters/python-3.py" />
Now we'll use LLM Gateway to process all of our `combined_paragraphs` and create
summaries for each one.

The summary for each paragraph then gets saved to a `results` array so we can output all of them at the same time.

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/input-text-chapters/python-4.py" />
The output will look similar to the example below.

Summary:
This transcript discusses the widespread impact of Canadian wildfires on air quality across the United States. Smoke from these fires is causing hazy conditions and air quality alerts in multiple states, prompting warnings to stay indoors in some areas. Peter DeCarlo, an environmental health expert from Johns Hopkins University, explains that dry conditions and specific weather patterns are channeling the smoke southward, affecting the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.

Start timestamp: 240
End timestamp: 60890

Summary:
The transcript discusses the unhealthy air quality in Baltimore due to high levels of particulate matter. These microscopic particles can affect respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological systems. The concentration of particulate matter has reached dangerous levels, measuring 150 micrograms per cubic meter, which is 10 times higher than the annual average and 4 times higher than the recommended 24-hour average.

Start timestamp: 62270
End timestamp: 113214

Summary:
The text discusses the health impacts of high levels of air pollution, likely due to smoke from wildfires. It explains that the concentration of particles in the air is much higher than usual, leading to various health problems. The most vulnerable groups are identified as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions, particularly respiratory or heart issues. The situation is severe enough that outdoor activities are being canceled in places like New York City, despite it being early summer.

Start timestamp: 113342
End timestamp: 158870

Summary:
The text discusses air quality issues related to smoke from wildfires. It mentions that some areas, like New York, are experiencing higher concentrations of smoke, but this will change as the air moves. The impact will vary across different areas over the next few days. The speaker doesn't expect concentrations to increase significantly even if more fires start. The duration of the smoke's impact on the US depends on weather system changes, while the fires themselves are expected to continue burning for some time.

Start timestamp: 162090
End timestamp: 203856

Summary:
The transcript discusses the impact of weather systems on smoke from wildfires affecting the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. It predicts that changing weather patterns will soon push the smoke away from these areas. The speaker also addresses the connection between climate change and increased wildfires, suggesting that such air quality issues may become more frequent in the future, particularly in the western United States.

Start timestamp: 203968
End timestamp: 258010

Summary:
Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University, discusses how climate change is likely to increase the frequency of extreme weather events in the eastern United States. He suggests that while such events are currently unusual for the region, they may become more common in the future due to climate change.
