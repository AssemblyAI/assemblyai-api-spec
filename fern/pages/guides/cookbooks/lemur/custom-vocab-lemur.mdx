title: "Boost Transcription Accuracy with LeMUR (LeMUR Custom Vocab)"
---

This Cookbook is designed to help you transcribe audio files using the AssemblyAI API and boost transcription accuracy using a custom vocabulary list and [LeMUR](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/lemur/). Custom vocabulary can include company names, industry-specific terms, and other rare words that might not be accurately transcribed by pre-trained models. For example, a company name like `Sprinklr` may be transcribed incorrectly, and this is where customer vocabulary boosting can help.

## Quickstart

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/custom-vocab-lemur/python-1.py" />
## Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup/) for an AssemblyAI account and get your API key from your [dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account).

### Side Note: Costs

We've optimized the LeMUR prompt to minimize the number of output tokens produced by the model, which will reduce the overall cost of this solution significantly, but if you do want to calculate the total number of input / output tokens and cost associated with them, please use our [LLM Gateway Input Token Estimation Guide](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides/counting-tokens) as a reference on how to do so.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Now let's install the AssemblyAI SDK and the [Termcolor library](https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/), which will be used for showing which corrections LeMUR has made to the transcript.

```bash
pip install -U assemblyai termcolor
```

Then we'll import the SDK and set our AssemblyAI API key.

```python
import assemblyai

assemblyai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Next, we'll transcribe our file and save it for later use with LeMUR.

```python
transcriber = assemblyai.Transcriber()

transcript = transcriber.transcribe("https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1E1UUnabkXH-wN-CGbr-zd9dT_izZg1e6&export=download")
```

Now we'll define our first function for this use case. This function will correct a given sentence using LeMUR with the provided custom vocab list. We'll then call this function for each sentence in our transcript to correct specific words. Please note, though, that this means each sentence will require another request to LeMUR, which may cause you to hit request per minute (RPM) limits and receive an error. If you do end up receiving RPM errors often, please reach out to support@assemblyai.com to have your RPM limit increased.

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/custom-vocab-lemur/python-2.py" />
Then we can define our second function. This function will extract all of the
sentences from our transcript and pass them to LeMUR with our custom vocabulary
list for correction. We'll be importing `termcolor` to show which words have
been corrected with LeMUR.

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/custom-vocab-lemur/python-3.py" />
## Run your Example

Now you can try an example using our sample MP3 file and some word corrections. We chose to use some media with a lot of unique words, a World of Warcraft trailer, to help showcase how this solution can account for multiple ways that a unique word might be mis-transcribed initially. Below is the original transcript, the corrections made, and the final corrected transcript for comparison.

``` Slender is the strand that guides our destiny, known only by true sacrifice.
In our kingdom of Ajkahet, no one understood this sacrifice more than Queen
Neferis, my mother. I saw this when the Black Empire came to conscript us for
their last stand at Nyalofa. My mother refused them for this treachery. Your
line will sever itself. This kingdom will wither with the waning of your words.
Her strength defined us that day. And in that moment, we felt destined for
greatness. But in the years that followed, our greatness was tarnished. Look at
them out there. Wretched, starving. I am not immune to our people's suffering. I
believe better days will come. Nothing if you keep failing to seize the moment.
What was the point of you freeing our future, only to leave us buried in the
past? You comprehend so little. There is much for you to learn before you can be
queen. Mother. Mother. Mother. Answeric, are you seeing this? You have heard my
voice in your dreams, great queen. The harbinger. Yes. Of the empire that was.
But the old gods are dead. The empire lies in ashes, and a shadow has fallen on
your kingdom. But the blood of the old gods can make your people powerful again.
Your brain could last for eternity. All you have to do is take my hand. Your
words are tempting, but the cost is too great. I would never risk my kingdom for
such power. Mother, who are you talking to? Oh, ghosts, dearest. As always, they
are my ready council. I'm not sorry for what I said. I only want our people to
be great once more. Greatness is fleeting. What we must do now is endure. Your
time will come, child, but only when you are ready. What you done? You're not
the only one seeing ghosts, mother. How sad to have a queen so wise and yet so
ignorant to the call of destiny. You. Her name is Xalatath. You heard your
chance. Motherhood. With this power, ash cahet is unbound. We will rise, we will
conquer. And together we will finally claim our destiny. Long live Queen
Anzarak. It.

Found correction: In our kingdom of Ajkahet, no one understood this sacrifice more than Queen Neferis, my mother.
Found correction: I saw this when the Black Empire came to conscript us for their last stand at Nyalofa.
Found correction: Answeric, are you seeing this?
Found correction: Her name is Xalatath.
Found correction: With this power, ash cahet is unbound.

Slender is the strand that guides our destiny, known only by true sacrifice. In our kingdom of Azj-Kahet, no one understood this sacrifice more than Queen Neferess, my mother. I saw this when the Black Empire came to conscript us for their last stand at Ny'alotha. My mother refused them for this treachery. Your line will sever itself.
