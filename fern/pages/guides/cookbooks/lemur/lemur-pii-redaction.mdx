title: "Redact PII from Text Using LLM Gateway"
---

This guide will show you how to use AssemblyAI's LLM Gateway to redact personally identifiable information (PII) from text.

## Quickstart

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/lemur-pii-redaction/python-1.py" />
## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for an account and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Import the required packages and set up your API client:

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/lemur-pii-redaction/python-2.py" />
Define a function `generate_ner` that uses LLM Gateway to identify named
entities (person names, organizations, emails, phone numbers, addresses) in a
given text.

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/lemur-pii-redaction/python-3.py" />
Transcribe an audio file using the AssemblyAI API:

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/lemur-pii-redaction/python-4.py" />
Split the transcript into sentences, identify named entities using
`generate_ner`, and replace them with # characters:

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/lemur-pii-redaction/python-5.py" />
Print the fully redacted transcript:

```python
print('\nFull redacted transcript:')
print(redacted_transcript)
```
