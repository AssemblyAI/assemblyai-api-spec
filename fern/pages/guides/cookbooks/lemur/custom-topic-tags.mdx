title: "Custom Topic Tags Using LLM Gateway"
---

In this guide we will show you how to label content with custom topic tags using AssemblyAI's LLM Gateway.

## Quickstart

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/custom-topic-tags/python-1.py" />
## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Set up your API client and transcribe the audio file:

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/custom-topic-tags/python-2.py" />
Create a `tag_list` of custom topics, which consists of a key that is the topic
and a value that is a short description of what qualifies a file to be labeled
with that topic.

Here is an example of a `tag_list` that can be used for videos or podcasts:

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/custom-topic-tags/python-3.py" />
Here is another example of a `tag_list` that can be used for support calls:

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/lemur/custom-topic-tags/python-4.py" />
Use LLM Gateway to analyze the transcript and select the most relevant topic
tag. This is an example prompt, which you can modify to suit your specific
requirements. See our documentation for more information about [prompt
engineering](/docs/llm-gateway/improving-your-prompt).
