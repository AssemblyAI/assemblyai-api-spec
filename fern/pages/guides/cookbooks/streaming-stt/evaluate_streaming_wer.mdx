title: "Evaluate Streaming transcription accuracy with WER"
---

Learn how to evaluate the accuracy of your AssemblyAI streaming transcripts using Word Error Rate (WER), the industry-standard metric for measuring speech-to-text performance. This guide walks you through setting up a complete benchmarking workflow to measure how well your streaming implementation performs against a reference transcript.

## Quickstart

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/evaluate_streaming_wer/python-1.py" />
## Step-by-step implementation

1. **Install the required dependencies**

```bash
pip install assemblyai whisper-normalizer jiwer
```

2. **Import the necessary libraries**

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/evaluate_streaming_wer/python-2.py" />
3. **Set up transcript collection** Create a global variable to store streaming
transcripts. Your streaming session will append to this variable as it processes
audio, and you'll use it for WER analysis.

```python
# Global variable to collect assembly transcripts
assembly_streaming_transcript = ""
```

4. **Configure streaming audio processing**
   Stream your audio file to the AssemblyAI endpoint. The `on_turn` function captures formatted transcripts and appends them to your collection variable.

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/evaluate_streaming_wer/python-3.py" />
5. **Prepare your reference transcript** Define the ground truth transcript for
comparison. This serves as your accuracy benchmark for the WER calculation.

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Create a high-quality reference transcript by first transcribing
  your audio file with AssemblyAI's Universal-3-Pro model, then manually
  reviewing and correcting any errors to achieve 100% accuracy.

```python
# Evaluate collected transcripts
reference_transcript = "AssemblyAI is a deep learning company that builds powerful APIs to help you transcribe and understand audio. The most common use case for the API is to automatically convert prerecorded audio and video files as well as real time audio streams into text transcriptions. Our APIs convert audio and video into text using powerful deep learning models that we research and develop end to end in house. Millions of podcasts, zoom recordings, phone calls or video files are being transcribed with Assembly AI every single day. But where Assembly AI really excels is with helping you understand your data. So let's say we transcribe Joe Biden's State of the Union using Assembly AI's API. With our Auto Chapters feature, you can generate time coded summaries of the key moments of your audio file. For example, with the State of the Union address we get chapter summaries like this. Auto Chapters automatically segments your audio or video files into chapters and provides a summary for each of these chapters. With Sentiment Analysis, we can classify what's being spoken in your audio files as either positive, negative or neutral. So for example, in the State of the Union address we see that this sentence was classified as positive, whereas this sentence was classified as negative. Content Safety Detection can flag sensitive content as it is spoken like hate speech, profanity, violence or weapons. For example, in Biden's State of the Union address, content safety detection flagged parts of his speech as being about weapons. This feature is especially useful for automatic content moderation and brand safety use cases. With Auto Highlights, you can automatically identify important words and phrases that are being spoken in your data owned by the State of the Union address. AssemblyAI's API detected these words and phrases as being important. Lastly, with entity detection you can identify entities that are spoken in your audio like organization names or person names. In Biden's speech, these were the entities that were detected. This is just a preview of the most popular features of AssemblyAI's API. If you want a full list of features, go check out our API documentation linked in the description below. And if you ever need some support, our team of developers is here to help. Everyday developers are using these features to build really exciting applications. From meeting summarizers to brand safety or contextual targeting platforms to full blown conversational intelligence tools. We can't wait to see what you build with AssemblyAI."
```

6. **Initialize text normalization**
   Set up the normalizer and create your WER calculation function to ensure consistent text formatting before comparison.

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/evaluate_streaming_wer/python-4.py" />
7. **Calculate your WER score** Run the final calculation to measure
transcription accuracy.

```python
wer_score = calculate_wer(reference_transcript, assembly_streaming_transcript.strip())
print(f"Final WER: {wer_score:.2f}%")
```
