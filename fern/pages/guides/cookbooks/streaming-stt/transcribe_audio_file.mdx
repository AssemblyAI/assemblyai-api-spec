title: "Transcribe audio files with Streaming"
---

This guide shows you how to transcribe **WAV audio files** with varying sample rates using our Streaming API.

## Quickstart

Here is the complete AssemblyAI Python SDK script to transcribe a WAV audio file using the Streaming API.

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/transcribe_audio_file/python-1.py" />
## Step-by-step guide

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) and get your API key from your [dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/api-keys).

### Install and import packages

Install the AssemblyAI Python SDK and pyaudio for audio playback.

```bash
pip install assemblyai
pip install pyaudio
```

Import packages.

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/transcribe_audio_file/python-2.py" />
### Configure settings

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key.

Set `AUDIO_FILE` to the relative or absolute path of your audio file, and set `SAMPLE_RATE` to match your file's sample rate.

See [Connect the client](/docs/guides/streaming_transcribe_audio_file#connect-the-client) to configure all other stream parameters.

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/transcribe_audio_file/python-3.py" />
### Websocket Event Handlers

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/transcribe_audio_file/python-4.py" />
### Create the streaming client

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/transcribe_audio_file/python-5.py" />
### Helper functions for streaming files

The following helper functions are used to validate audio files, stream audio in chunks, and save the transcript output:

- `validate_audio_file()` - Validates that the audio file is a mono WAV file with the expected sample rate.
- `stream_file()` - Streams the audio file in 50ms chunks, optionally playing audio through speakers.
- `save_transcript()` - Saves the transcript to a text file after the session ends.

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/transcribe_audio_file/python-6.py" />
### Connect the client

A warning is printed if default turn detection parameters are used. This is fine for testing, but for best accuracy and optimal performance, see our [recommended settings](/docs/universal-streaming/turn-detection#quick-start-configurations).

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/transcribe_audio_file/python-7.py" />
### Stream the file

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/streaming-stt/transcribe_audio_file/python-8.py" />
The session will terminate once the file is finished streaming. If
`SAVE_TRANSCRIPT_TO_FILE` is enabled (default), the transcript will be saved to
`{audio_filename}_{session_id}.txt` in the current working directory.

<Note>
  The `AUDIO_FILE` path can be either relative (e.g., `audio.wav`) or absolute
  (e.g., `/path/to/audio.wav`).
</Note>

## Example output

Here's an example of what the console output looks like when streaming an audio file:

```console

The output shows:

- **Partial transcripts**: Real-time updates as words are recognized
- **Final (unformatted)**: The complete turn before formatting is applied
- **Final (formatted)**: The final transcript with proper capitalization and punctuation
