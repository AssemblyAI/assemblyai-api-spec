In this guide, we'll show you how to configure your code to utilise the EU endpoint when interacting directly with the API, as well as across our SDKs.

<Info>
  Streaming is now available in EU-West via `streaming.eu.assemblyai.com`
</Info>

### Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

### Python (Requests)

The only difference here is adding the `eu.` subdomain to the base URL. Everything else in your request code stays the same:

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/how_to_use_the_eu_endpoint/python-1.py" />
### Python SDK

To set the EU endpoint as the base URL when using the Python SDK, add the following line of code before setting the `Transcriber` object:

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.base_url = "https://api.eu.assemblyai.com" // Set the base URL to the EU endpoint
```

### JavaScript (Axios)

Similar to the requests library for Python, the only difference here is adding the `eu.` subdomain to the base URL as follows:

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/how_to_use_the_eu_endpoint/python-2.py" />
### JavaScript SDK

To set the EU endpoint as the base URL when using the JavaScript SDK, set the `baseUrl` parameter in your AssemblyAI client as follows:

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/how_to_use_the_eu_endpoint/python-3.py" />
## Streaming Speech-to-Text

For streaming transcription, use the EU streaming endpoint `streaming.eu.assemblyai.com`.

### Python SDK (Streaming)

To use the EU streaming endpoint with the Python SDK:

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/how_to_use_the_eu_endpoint/python-4.py" />
### JavaScript SDK (Streaming)

To use the EU streaming endpoint with the JavaScript SDK:

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/how_to_use_the_eu_endpoint/javascript.js" />
### WebSocket (Direct)

When connecting directly via WebSocket, use the EU streaming base URL:

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/how_to_use_the_eu_endpoint/python-5.py" />
