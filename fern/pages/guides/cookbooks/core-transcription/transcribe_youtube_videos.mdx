title: "Get YouTube Video Transcripts with yt-dlp"
---

In this guide, we'll show you how to transcribe YouTube videos.

For this, we use the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) library to download YouTube videos and then transcribe it with the AssemblyAI API.

`yt-dlp` is a [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) fork with additional features and fixes. It is better maintained and preferred over `youtube-dl` nowadays.

In this guide we'll show 2 different approaches:

- Option 1: Download video via CLI
- Option 2: Download video via code

Let's get started!

## Quickstart

# Step-by-step guide

## Install Dependencies

Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and the [AssemblyAI Python SDK](https://github.com/AssemblyAI/assemblyai-python-sdk) via pip.

```bash
pip install -U yt-dlp
```

```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

## Option 1: Download video via CLI

In this approach we download the YouTube video via the command line and then transcribe it via the AssemblyAI API. We use the following video here:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtolixa9XTg

To download it, use the `yt-dlp` command with the following options:

- `-f m4a/bestaudio`: The format should be the best audio version in m4a format.
- `-o "%(id)s.%(ext)s"`: The output name should be the id followed by the extension. In this example, the video gets saved to "wtolixa9XTg.m4a".
- `wtolixa9XTg`: the id of the video.

```bash
yt-dlp -f m4a/bestaudio -o "%(id)s.%(ext)s" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtolixa9XTg
```

Next, set up the AssemblyAI SDK and trancribe the file. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your own key. If you don't have one, you can [sign up here](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for free.

Make sure that the path you pass to the `transcribe()` function corresponds to the saved filename.

## Option 2: Download video via code

In this approach we download the video with a Python script instead of the command line.

You can download the file with the following code:

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/transcribe_youtube_videos/python-3.py" />
After downloading, you can use the same code from option 1 to transcribe the
file:

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/transcribe_youtube_videos/python-4.py" />
