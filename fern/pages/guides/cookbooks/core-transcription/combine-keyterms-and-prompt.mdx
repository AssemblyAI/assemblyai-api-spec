title: "Combine Keyterms Prompting with Prompts"
---

Our [Universal-3-Pro model](https://www.assemblyai.com/universal-3-pro) supports natural language and keyterms prompting, allowing you to fine-tune transcription results to your specific use case. Check out [this section](/docs/getting-started/universal-3-pro) of our docs to learn more. By default, these two parameters, `prompt` and `keyterms_prompt`, cannot be used in the same request, but this guide will show you how they can be used together in a single transcription request if desired.

<Warning>
  **We recommend using either `prompt` OR `keyterms_prompt` individually, not
  both together.** Combining both parameters can result in overprompting,
  leading to unpredictable or degraded results, so if you do attempt to use both
  together, be conscious of the length of your prompt and how many terms you are
  passing.

## Get Started

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An AssemblyAI account with an API key
- Python 3.7+ or Node.js 14+ installed

## Understanding the Two Features

### Keyterms Prompting (`keyterms_prompt`)

Use `keyterms_prompt` to provide up to 1,000 specific words or phrases (maximum 6 words per phrase) to improve transcription accuracy for those exact terms. This is ideal for:

- Names with unusual spellings (e.g., "Kelly Byrne-Donoghue")
- Brand names and product names
- Technical terminology
- Acronyms and abbreviations

### Prompting (`prompt`)

Use `prompt` to provide up to 1,500 words of general context and instructions in plain language. This helps the model:

- Apply formatting conventions
- Understand domain context
- Handle code-switching between languages
- Interpret ambiguous speech

<Note>
  For best results, keep prompts concise (3-5 instructions, 50-80 words). Overly
  long prompts can cause the model to degrade in transcription quality as it
  tries to process conflicting instructions.
</Note>

## Conclusion

While you can use both `keyterms_prompt` and `prompt` together, **we recommend using the `prompt` parameter with your keyterms included as context**. This approach provides both domain context and term accuracy in a single parameter.
