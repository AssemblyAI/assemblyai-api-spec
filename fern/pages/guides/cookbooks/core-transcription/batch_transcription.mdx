title: "Transcribe Multiple Files Simultaneously Using the Python SDK"
---

In this guide, we'll show you how to use the AssemblyAI API to transcribe multiple audio files at once. This guide focuses on demonstrating how to use the AssemblyAI Python SDK to achieve this.

## Quickstart

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/batch_transcription/python-1.py" />
## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Install the SDK.

```python
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai `package and set the API key. Import `threading` and `OS` Python libraries that enable concurrent task processing and file path interactions respectively.

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/batch_transcription/python-2.py" />
Set the folders. The `batch` folder contains the audio files that you want to
process and transcribe. The `transcription_result_folder` stores the .txt
transcript files.

```python
batch_folder = "audio"
transcription_result_folder = "transcripts"
```

Create a `Transcriber` object.

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
```

Function to transcribe an audio file. Once the transcript is complete, a .txt file is generated to the `transcription_result_folder`. If there is an error with the transcription, it will not be processed to the results folder.

Open threads to transcribe each file concurrently. Once all the threads are
complete you will receive the "All transcriptions are complete" message in your
terminal.

## Conclusion

This guide aims to demonstrate how to use AssemblyAI Python SDK to concurrently process multiple audio files at once. The output is transcript text files for each audio file in the specified folder.

Other integrations and features can be built on top of this main function. These include and are not limited to: exporting the file in different formats, adding Core Transcription or Audio Intelligence features.
