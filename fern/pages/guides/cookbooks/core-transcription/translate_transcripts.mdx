title: "Translate AssemblyAI Transcripts Into Other Languages Using Commercial Models"
---

This Cookbook walks through how to translate AssemblyAI transcripts using a variety of commerical and open-source machine translation models.

Choosing a model depends on your use-case and preferences. Here are some considerations you may want to make when choosing a model to use for translation:

- Accuracy and Quality of Translation: you should compare the translations from each provider to see which translation you prefer
- Language Support: check the supported languages for [Google Translate](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages), [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/translate-text), and [python-translate](https://github.com/terryyin/translate-python) respectively
- Cost: while commercial models usually have a free-tier or trials, they will incur costs eventually

## Setup

To get started, paste your API token into the empty string below. If you don't already have an API token, you can get one for free [here](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup).

```python
AAI_API_TOKEN = ""
```

**Make sure not to share this token with anyone** - it is a private key associated uniquely to your account.

Next, we'll install the AssemblyAI Python SDK.

```bash
pip install "assemblyai"
```

Finally, import the `assemblyai` package and set your API token in the settings:

```python
import assemblyai as aai

# set the API key
aai.settings.api_key = f"{AAI_API_TOKEN}"
```

```python
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(language_detection=True)
transcriber = aai.Transcriber(config=config)

transcript = transcriber.transcribe('./my-audio.mp3')
```

Specify the target language for the translation

```python
to_lang = 'en'
```

Get detected language code from the AAI JSON response

```python
from_lang = transcript.json_response['language_code']
```

# Commercial Models

## Google Translate API

https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/libraries/v2/python

Note: you will need a GCP account as well as app credentials to make this API request.

```bash
pip install google-cloud-translate==2.0.1
```

Follow Google's docs on how to generate a credentials JSON file: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials

```python
import os
os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = './translate_creds.json'
```

## DeepL API

https://www.deepl.com/en/docs-api

```bash
pip install deepl
```

You will need a DeepL account and API token, which can be found here: https://www.deepl.com/pro-api

```python
DEEPL_API_TOKEN = ''
```

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/translate_transcripts/python-2.py" />
# Open-Source Models

## `translate-python` Library

https://github.com/terryyin/translate-python

```bash
pip install translate
```
