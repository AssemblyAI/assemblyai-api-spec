title: "Plot A Speaker Timeline with Matplotlib"
---

In this guide, we'll show you how to plot a speaker timeline with matplotlib, using results from the speaker diarization model.

## Quickstart

### Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the SDK.

```bash
pip install -U assemblyai
!pip install -U matplotlib
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set the API key.

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Create a `TranscriptionConfig` object and set speaker labels to `True`.

```python
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(speaker_labels=True)
```

Create a `Transcriber` object.

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
```

Use the Transcriber object's `transcribe` method and pass in the audio file's path and `config` object as parameters. The transcribe method saves the results of the transcription to the `Transcriber` object's `transcript` attribute.

```python
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("./my-audio.mp3", config)
```

<Tip> Alternatively, you can use an audio URL available on the internet. </Tip>

Extract the utterances from the transcript and set this to `utterances`.

```python
utterances = transcript.utterances
```

Import the `matplotlib.pyplot` library. Then use the following `plot_speaker_timeline` function which results in a plot image of the speaker timeline. This function extracts the `start` and `end` timestamps of each `utterance` per `speaker` and plots the data onto the horizontal bar chart. The X and Y axis are labelled accordingly.

Finally, call the `plot_speaker_timeline` function passing `utterances` as a
parameter to see the plot image result.

```python
plot_speaker_timeline(utterances)
```
