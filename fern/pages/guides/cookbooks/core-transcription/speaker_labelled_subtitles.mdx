title: "Create Subtitles with Speaker Labels"
---

## Quickstart

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/speaker_labelled_subtitles/python-1.py" />
This Colab will demonstrate how to use AssemblyAI's [Speaker
Diarization](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization)
model together to format subtitles according to their respective speaker.

## Step-by-step guide

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for an AssemblyAI account and get your API key from your [dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account).

```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

First, we will configure our API key as well as our file to be transcribed. Then, we decide on a number of words we want to have per subtitle.

Lastly, we transcribe our file.

## How the code works

`speaker_colors` is a dictionary that maps speaker identifiers (like "A", "B", "C", etc.) to specific colors. Each speaker in the transcription will be associated with a unique color in the subtitles.

When Speaker Diarization is enabled, sentences in our API response have a speaker code under the `speaker` key. We use the speaker code to determine the color of the subtitle text.

Our last step is to generate and save our subtitle file!
