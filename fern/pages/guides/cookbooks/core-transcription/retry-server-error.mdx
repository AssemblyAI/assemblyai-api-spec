title: "Implement Retry Server Error Logic"
---

In this guide, we'll show you how to setup automatic server error retry logic in your transcription process.

Server errors indicate a server-side issue during the transcription process. These rarely happen, but can occasionally occur on our side. If a transcription fails due to a server error, we recommend that you resubmit the file for transcription to allow another server to process the audio. If the issue persists, please reach out to our support team: support@assemblyai.com

This workflow is designed to automatically retry these transcripts if a server error is encountered.

<Tip>
  If your transcription fails due to a server error on our side, we will
  automatically retry the request up to three times. You can find this option in
  your [Account Settings](https://assemblyai.com/app/account).

## Quickstart

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/retry-server-error/python-1.py" />
## Get started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-step instructions

Install the SDK:

```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` and `time` package and set your API key:

```python
import assemblyai as aai
import time

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Create a function that handles errors that may occur during the transcription process. The default number of retires is 1. The default wait time before retranscribing is 5 seconds.

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/retry-server-error/python-2.py" />
Define the audio file that you want to transcribe.

```python
audio_url = "YOUR_AUDIO_URL"
```

Create a `Transcriber` object and specify features in `TranscriptionConfig`.

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig()
```

Call the function to handle transcription with error handling. Specify number of retries and wait time. Return the transcribed text if transcription is successful.

```python
transcript = handle_error_transcription(audio_url, transcriber, config, retries=1, wait_time=5)
if transcript:
    print(transcript.text)
```
