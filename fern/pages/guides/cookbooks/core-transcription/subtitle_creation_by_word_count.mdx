title: "Create Custom Length Subtitles"
---

While our SRT/VTT endpoints do allow you to customize the maximum number of characters per caption using the chars_per_caption URL parameter in your API requests, there are some use-cases that require a custom number of words in each subtitle.

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to construct these subtitles yourself in Python!

## Quickstart

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/subtitle_creation_by_word_count/python-1.py" />
## Step-by-Step Instructions

```python
pip install -U assemblyai

```

Create a `main.py` file and import the `assemblyai` package and set the API key.

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR-API-KEY"
```

Create a Transcriber object.

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
```

Use the Transcriber object's transcribe method and pass in the audio file's path as a parameter. The transcribe method saves the results of the transcription to the Transcriber object's transcript attribute.

```python
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("./my-audio.mp3")
```

Alternatively, you can pass in the URL of the publicly accessible audio file on the internet.

```python
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-docs-samples/espn.m4a")
```

Define a function that converts seconds to timecodes

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/subtitle_creation_by_word_count/python-2.py" />
Define a function that iterates through the transcripts object to construct a
list according to the number of words per subtitle

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/subtitle_creation_by_word_count/python-3.py" />
Generate your subtitle file

<Code src="snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/subtitle_creation_by_word_count/python-4.py" />
Run your script.

```bash
python main.py
```
