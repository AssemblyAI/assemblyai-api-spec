title: "Transcribe from an S3 Bucket"
---

AssemblyAI's Speech-to-Text APIs can be used with both local files and publicly accessible online files, but what if you want to transcribe an audio file that has restricted access? Luckily, you can do this with AssemblyAI too!

Read on to learn how you can transcribe an audio file stored in an AWS S3 bucket using AssemblyAI's APIs.

## Intro

In order to transcribe an audio file from an S3 bucket, AssemblyAI will need temporary access to the file. To provide this access, we'll generate a **presigned URL**, which is simply a URL that has temporary access rights baked-in.

The overall process looks like this:

1. Generate a presigned URL for the S3 audio file with [boto](http://boto.cloudhackers.com/en/latest).
2. Pass this URL through to AssemblyAI's API with a POST request.
3. Wait until the transcription is complete, and then fetch it with a GET request.

## Prerequisites

First, you'll need an AssemblyAI account. You can sign up [here](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account if you don't already have one.

Next, you'll need to **take note of your AssemblyAI API key**, which you can find on your [account dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account) after signing in. It will be on the left-hand side of the screen under _Your API Key_.

You'll need the value of this key later, so leave the browser window open or copy the value into a text file.

## AWS IAM User

Second, you'll need an AWS IAM user with `Programmatic` access and the `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` permission. If you already have such an IAM user and you know its public and private keys, then you can move on to the next section. Otherwise, create one now as follows:

First, log into AWS as a root user or as another IAM user with the appropriate access, and then go to the [IAM Management Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?ref=assemblyai.com#/users) to add a new user.

Set the user name you would like, and select _Programmatic access_ under _Select AWS access type:_

Click _Next_, and then _Attach existing policies directly_. Copy and paste _AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess_ into the _Filter policies_ search box, and then add this permission by clicking on the checkbox next to it:

Click _Next_ and add tags if you wish. Then click _Next_ and review the IAM user profile to ensure that everything looks copacetic before clicking _Create user_.

Finally, take note of the IAM user's _Access key ID_ and _Secret access key_. Again, **we will need these values later**, so copy them into a text file before moving on.

**Warning**
Make sure to copy the IAM user's _Secret access key_ and record it somewhere safe. Once you close the final window of the _Add user_ sequence, you will not be able to access this key again and will need to regenerate it if you forget/lose the original.

## Code

First, the necessary packages are installed.

```bash
pip install -U boto3 botocore
```

Then we can import them and set our relevant variable values. You'll need to edit these variables to be equivalent to the relevant values for your application:

1. `bucket_name` - The name of your AWS S3 bucket.
2. `object_name` - The name of the audio file in the S3 bucket that you want to transcribe.
3. `iam_access_id` - The access ID of the IAM user with programmatic access and S3 read permission.
4. `iam_secret_key` - The secret key of the IAM user.
5. `assembly_key` - Your AssemblyAI API key.
