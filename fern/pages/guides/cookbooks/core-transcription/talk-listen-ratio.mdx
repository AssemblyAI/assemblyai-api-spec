title: "Calculate the Talk / Listen Ratio of Speakers"
---

This guide will show you how to use AssemblyAI's API to calculate the talk/listen ratio of speakers in a transcript. The following code uses the [Python SDK](https://github.com/AssemblyAI/assemblyai-python-sdk).

## Quickstart

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/talk-listen-ratio/python-1.py" />
## Get started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the SDK:

```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set the API key.

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Define a function called `calculate_talk_listen_ratios`, which will calculate the talk-listen ratios for all speakers from a transcript with speaker labels. Speaker labels must be enabled for the ratios to be calculated.

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/talk-listen-ratio/python-2.py" />
Define a `transcriber`, an `audio_url` set to a link to the audio file (replace
the example link that is provided with your own), and a `TranscriptionConfig`
with `speaker_labels=True`. Then create a transcript which will be sent to the
function `calculate_talk_listen_ratios` and print out the results.

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/talk-listen-ratio/python-3.py" />
Example output when using the above sample audio file:

```
{'Speaker A': {'talk_time_ms': 244196, 'percentage': 42.77, 'talk_listen_ratio': 0.75}, 'Speaker B': {'talk_time_ms': 326766, 'percentage': 57.23, 'talk_listen_ratio': 1.34}}
```
