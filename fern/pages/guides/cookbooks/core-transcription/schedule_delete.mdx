title: "Schedule a DELETE request with AssemblyAI and EasyCron"
---

This tutorial guides you through the process of scheduling a DELETE request for a transcript created with AssemblyAI's transcription service, utilizing EasyCron for scheduling.

## Quickstart

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/schedule_delete/python-1.py" />
## Step-by-step guide

To get started, install the AssemblyAI Python SDK.

```bash
pip install "assemblyai"
```

Finally, import the `assemblyai` package and set your API token in the settings:

```python
import assemblyai as aai

# set the API key
aai.settings.api_key = f"{YOUR_API_KEY}"
```

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

# this is just an example file
transcript = transcriber.transcribe('https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3')
```

Store the transcript ID

```python
transcript_id = transcript.id
```

Using this, we now construct the URL that we want our `cron` job to call.

```python
url_to_call = f"https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript/{transcript_id}"
```

## Using EasyCron's API to schedule a DELETE request

First, sign up for an account with EasyCron [here](https://www.easycron.com/cron-jobs). Locate your EasyCron API key [in your user dashboard.](https://www.easycron.com/user/token)

Then, insert your EasyCron API key into your code.

Next, we will use the datetime module to generate a `cron` expression for 24 hours from now (although you can configure the `timedelta` argument to be whatever you want)

<Code src="../../../../snippets/guides/cookbooks/core-transcription/schedule_delete/python-2.py" />
Now, we will schedule a `cron` job 24 hours from now with EasyCron to send a
delete request to AssemblyAI for the transcript that we just generated.

## Troubleshooting:

`Error 3: The cron expression you entered is invalid or it cannot be matched in a realitic future.`: Check that your [EasyCron account settings](https://www.easycron.com/user/edit) has UTC configured as the default timezone.
