title: "Use Automatic Language Detection as a Separate Step From Transcription"
---

In this guide, we'll show you how to perform automatic language detection separately from the transcription process. For the transcription, the file then gets then routed to either our [_Universal_ or _Nano_](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/select-the-speech-model) model class, depending on the supported language.

This workflow is designed to be cost-effective, slicing the first 60 seconds of audio and running it through Nano ALD, which detects 99 languages, at a cost of $0.002 per transcript for this language detection workflow (not including the total transcription cost).

## Get started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-step instructions

Install the SDK:

```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set your API key:

```python
import assemblyai as aai
aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Create a set with all supported languages for _Universal_. You can find them in our [documentation here](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/concepts/supported-languages#supported-languages-for-universal).

Define a `Transcriber`. Note that here we don't pass in a global
`TranscriptionConfig`, but later apply different ones during the `transcribe()`
call.

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
```

Define two helper functions:

- `detect_language()` performs language detection on the [first 60 seconds](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/transcripts/submit#request.body.audio_end_at) of the audio using _Nano_ and returns the language code.
- `transcribe_file()` performs the transcription. For this, the identified language is applied and either _Universal_ or _Nano_ is used depending on the supported language.

Test the code with different audio files. For each file, we apply both helper
functions sequentially to first identify the language and then transcribe the
file.
