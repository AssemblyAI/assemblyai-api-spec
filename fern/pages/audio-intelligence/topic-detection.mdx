The Topic Detection model lets you identify different topics in the transcript. The model uses the [IAB Content Taxonomy](https://airtable.com/shr7KNXOtvfhTTS4i/tblqVLDb7YSsCMXo4?backgroundColor=purple&viewControls=on), a standardized language for content description which consists of 698 comprehensive topics.

  Most of these libraries are included by default, but on .NET Framework and
  Mono you need to reference the System.Net.Http library and install the
  [System.Net.Http.Json NuGet
  package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Net.Http.Json).

## Frequently asked questions

{" "}

<Accordion
  title="How does the Topic Detection model handle misspelled or unrecognized words?"
  theme="dark"
  iconColor="white"
>
  <p>
    The Topic Detection model uses natural language processing and machine
    learning to identify related words and phrases even if they are misspelled
    or unrecognized. However, the accuracy of the detection may depend on the
    severity of the misspelling or the obscurity of the word.
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="Can I use the Topic Detection model to identify entities that aren't part of the IAB Taxonomy?"
  theme="dark"
  iconColor="white"
>
  <p>
    No, the Topic Detection model can only identify entities that are part of
    the IAB Taxonomy. The model is optimized for contextual targeting use cases,
    so using the predefined IAB categories ensures the most accurate results.
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="Why am I not getting any topic predictions for my audio file?"
  theme="dark"
  iconColor="white"
>
  <p>
    There could be several reasons why you aren't getting any topic predictions
    for your audio file. One possible reason is that the audio file doesn't
    contain enough relevant content for the model to analyze. Additionally, the
    accuracy of the predictions may be affected by factors such as background
    noise, low-quality audio, or a low confidence threshold for topic detection.
    It's recommended to review and adjust the model's configuration parameters
    and to provide high-quality, relevant audio files for analysis.
  </p>

<Accordion
  title="Why am I getting inaccurate or irrelevant topic predictions for my audio file?"
  theme="dark"
  iconColor="white"
>
  <p>
    There could be several reasons why you're getting inaccurate or irrelevant
    topic predictions for your audio file. One possible reason is that the audio
    file contains background noise or other non-relevant content that's
    interfering with the model's analysis. Additionally, the accuracy of the
    predictions may be affected by factors such as low-quality audio, a low
    confidence threshold for topic detection, or insufficient training data.
    It's recommended to review and adjust the model's configuration parameters,
    to provide high-quality, relevant audio files for analysis, and to consider
    adding additional training data to the model.

  <p>
    As of 2023, AssemblyAI is a partner with the Interactive Advertising Bureau
    (IAB), a certification and community for advertising across the internet.
    AssemblyAI built Topic Detection using the IAB Taxonomy, which is a
    blueprint of the approximately 700 topics used to categorize ads.
