The Entity Detection model lets you automatically identify and categorize key information in transcribed audio content.

Here are a few examples of what you can detect:

- Names of people
- Organizations
- Addresses
- Phone numbers
- Medical data
- Social security numbers

For the full list of entities that you can detect, see [Supported entities](#supported-entities).

<Tip title="Supported Languages">
  Entity Detection is available in multiple languages. See [Supported
  languages](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/supported-languages).

<Accordion title="How can I improve the accuracy of the Entity Detection model?" theme="dark" iconColor="white" >
  
To improve the accuracy of the Entity Detection model, it's recommended to provide high-quality audio files with clear and distinct speech. In addition, it's important to ensure that the audio content is relevant to the use case and that the entities being detected are relevant to the intended analysis. Finally, it may be helpful to review and adjust the model's configuration parameters, such as the confidence threshold for entity detection, to optimize the results.
