## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion
  title="How does the Key Phrases model identify important phrases in my transcription?"
  theme="dark"
  iconColor="white"
>
  <p>
    The Key Phrases model uses natural language processing and machine learning
    algorithms to analyze the frequency and distribution of words and phrases in
    your transcription. The algorithm identifies key phrases based on their
    relevancy score, which takes into account factors such as the number of
    times a phrase occurs, the distance between occurrences, and the overall
    length of the transcription.
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="What is the difference between the Key Phrases model and the Topic Detection model?"
  theme="dark"
  iconColor="white"
>
  <p>
    The Key Phrases model is designed to identify important phrases and words in
    your transcription, whereas the Topic Detection model is designed to
    categorize your transcription into predefined topics. While both models use
    natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, they have
    different goals and approaches to analyzing your text.
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="Can the Key Phrases model handle misspelled or unrecognized words?"
  theme="dark"
  iconColor="white"
>
  <p>
    Yes, the Key Phrases model can handle misspelled or unrecognized words to
    some extent. However, the accuracy of the detection may depend on the
    severity of the misspelling or the obscurity of the word. It's recommended
    to provide high-quality, relevant audio files with accurate transcriptions
    for the best results.
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="What are some limitations of the Key Phrases model?"
  theme="dark"
  iconColor="white"
>
  <p>
    Some limitations of the Key Phrases model include its limited understanding
    of context, which may lead to inaccuracies in identifying the most important
    phrases in certain cases, such as text with heavy use of jargon or idioms.
    Additionally, the model assigns higher scores to words or phrases that occur
    more frequently in the text, which may lead to an over-representation of
    common words and phrases that may not be as important in the context of the
    text. Finally, the Key Phrases model is a general-purpose algorithm that
    can't be easily customized or fine-tuned for specific domains, meaning it
    may not perform as well for specialized texts where certain keywords or
    concepts may be more important than others.
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="How can I optimize the performance of the Key Phrases model?"
  theme="dark"
  iconColor="white"
>
  <p>
    To optimize the performance of the Key Phrases model, it's recommended to
    provide high-quality, relevant audio files with accurate transcriptions, to
    review and adjust the model's configuration parameters, such as the
    confidence threshold for key phrase detection, and to refer to the list of
    identified key phrases to guide the analysis. It may also be helpful to
    consider adding additional training data to the model or consulting with
    AssemblyAI support for further assistance.
