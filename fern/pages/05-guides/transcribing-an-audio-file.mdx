description: 'Learn how to transcribe a local file with the AssemblyAI API'
---

In this guide, we'll show you how to use the API to transcribe your audio files.

You can also learn the content on this page from [How to Transcribe Audio Files with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTWM5WuPhlQ) on [AssemblyAI's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AssemblyAI).

<Tip>

If you're using Python or TypeScript, see [Transcribe an audio file](/docs/getting-started/transcribe-an-audio-file).

</Tip>

## Get started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

The entire source code of this guide can be viewed [here](https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Community/docs-snippets/tree/main/transcribing).

## Understanding the response

The AssemblyAI API returns JSON-formatted output. Your transcription will be located in the `text` key. You'll also find a timestamp and a confidence score for each word inside of the `words` key, as well as other parameters assigned by the API such as `language_code` and `language_model`.

<EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint='GET /v2/transcript/{transcript_id}' />

Refer to the [API reference](https://assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/transcripts/get#response) for a breakdown of every element in your transcript output.


## Best practices

When using the AssemblyAI API to transcribe audio files, we recommended using the polling technique to check for the status of the transcription. This means making a request every few seconds to check if the transcription is complete, as described above.

Alternatively, you can also set up [webhooks](/docs/getting-started/webhooks) to receive notifications when the transcription is complete. This can help reduce the overhead of polling and make your application more efficient.

## Conclusion

Transcription is our core API use case, and nearly all other AssemblyAI features leverage our transcription functionality. We're constantly improving and updating the [language models](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/releasing-our-new-v9-transcription-model-11-better-accuracy/) used by our [transcription engine](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/conformer-2/). Of course, higher quality audio generally produces better results.

We'd love to hear about any new integrations or solutions that you build using our transcription API — you can find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AssemblyAI) or apply to join our [Creators Program](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/introducing-assemblyai-creators-program/). You can also try out the <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/playground/source" target="_blank">AssemblyAI Playground</a> to experiment with our transcription features without needing to write any code!
