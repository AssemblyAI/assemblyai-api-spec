title: 'Use the LeMUR Specialized Endpoints'
---





In this guide, we'll show you how to use the specialized endpoints:

- Custom Summary
- Question & Answer
- Action Items

Those endpoints require no prompt engineering and facilitate more deterministic and structured outputs for predefined tasks.

### Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for an account and get your API key from your dashboard.

LeMUR features are currently only available to paid users, at two pricing tiers: LeMUR and LeMUR Basic. Refer to [pricing](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing) for more details.

### Custom Summary

Generate use case-specific content based on external content, formatting guidelines, and accurate transcripts.

Install the SDK.


```python
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set your API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Use the `Transcriber` object's `transcribe` method and pass in the audio files' paths as a parameter. The `transcribe` method saves the results of the transcription to a `Transcriber` object's `transcript_group` attribute.


```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
transcript_group = transcriber.transcribe_group(
    [
        "https://example.org/customer1.mp3",
        "https://example.org/customer2.mp3",
    ],
)
```

Next, define your LeMUR request parameters for Custom Summary.


```python
params = {
    "context": "The caller is intersted in buying a car.",
    "answer_format": "Short sentence"
}
```

Run `lemur`'s `summarize` method on your transcript(s) and pass in `params` as a parameter. The result is stored in `response` as a string.


```python
result = transcript_group.lemur.summarize(**params, final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet)

print(result.response)
```

### Question & Answer

Ask questions about what was covered in a single transcript or across multiple transcripts.

Install the SDK.


```python
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set your API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Use the `Transcriber` object's `transcribe` method and pass in the audio files' paths as a parameter. The `transcribe` method saves the results of the transcription to the `Transcriber` object's `transcript_group` attribute.


```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
transcript_group = transcriber.transcribe_group(
    [
        "https://example.org/customer1.mp3",
        "https://example.org/customer2.mp3",
    ],
)
```

Next, define your LeMUR request parameters for Q&A.


```python
questions = [
    aai.LemurQuestion(
        question="Is this caller a qualified buyer?",
        answer_options=[
            "Yes",
            "No"
        ],
    ),
    aai.LemurQuestion(
        question="What is the caller's mood?",
        answer_format="Short sentence"
    ),
]
```

Run `lemur`'s `question` method on your transcript(s) and pass in `questions` as a parameter. The result is stored in `result`.


```python
result = transcript_group.lemur.question(questions, final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet)
```

Access the Question and Answer results through the `question` and `answer` properties of the `response`.


```python
for question_answer in result.response:
    print(f"Question: {q.question}")
    print(f"Answer: {q.answer}")
```

### Action Items

Generate a list of action items based on the transcript(s) for follow up.

Install the SDK.


```python
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set your API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Use the `Transcriber` object's `transcribe` method and pass in the audio files' paths as a parameter. The `transcribe` method saves the results of the transcription to the `Transcriber` object's `transcript_group` attribute.


```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
transcript_group = transcriber.transcribe_group(
    [
        "https://example.org/customer1.mp3",
        "https://example.org/customer2.mp3",
    ],
)
```

Next, define your LeMUR request parameters for Action Items.


```python
params = {
    "context": "this is a support call"
}
```

Run `lemur`'s `action_items` method on your transcript(s) and pass in `params` as a parameter. The result is stored in `response` as a string.


```python
result = transcript_group.lemur.action_items(**params)

print(result.response)
```
