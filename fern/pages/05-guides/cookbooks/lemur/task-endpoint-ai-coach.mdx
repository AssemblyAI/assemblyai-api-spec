result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt,
    final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)

response = result.response
print(response)
```

## Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard. You will need to upgrade your account by adding a credit card to have access to LeMUR.

Find more details on the current LeMUR pricing in the AssemblyAI [pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing#:~:text=LeMUR).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

In this guide, we'll prompt LeMUR to perform some AI coaching.

First, let's install the AssemblyAI SDK.


```bash
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Then we'll import the SDK and set our AssemblyAI API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "API_KEY"
```

Next, we'll use AssemblyAI to transcribe a file and save our transcript.


```python
audio_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/meeting.mp4"

transcript = aai.Transcriber().transcribe(audio_url)
```

Provide detailed instructions to prompt LeMUR to provide feedback on your sales call, meeting, or other content.


```python
prompt = f"""
- You are an expert at providing valuable feedback to individuals.

- Your communication is clear, accurate and concise, and you write with perfect English.
- Directly start with the feedback without any preamble or introduction.

Prompt the LeMUR model using the Task Endpoint and return the response.


```python
result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt,
    final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)

response = result.response
print(response)
```
