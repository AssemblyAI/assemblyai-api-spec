# LeMUR Task Endpoint Custom Summary

This Colab will demonstrate how to use AssemblyAI's [LeMUR](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/lemur/) (Leveraging Large Language Models to Understand Recognized Speech) framework to get a custom summary using the Task endpoint.

### Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard. You will need to upgrade your account by adding a credit card to have access to LeMUR.

Find more details on the current LeMUR pricing in the AssemblyAI [pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing#:~:text=LeMUR).

### Step-by-Step Instructions

In this guide, we will prompt LeMUR to generate a summary.

First, let's install the AssemblyAI SDK.


```python
%pip install -U assemblyai
```

Then we'll import the SDK and set our AssemblyAI API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "API_KEY"
```

Next, we'll use AssemblyAI to transcribe a file and save our transcript.


```python
audio_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/meeting.mp4"

transcript = aai.Transcriber().transcribe(audio_url)
```

Provide detailed instructions to prompt LeMUR to summarize the transcript.


```python
prompt = f"""
- You are an expert at writing factual, useful summaries.
- You focus on key details, leave out irrelevant information, and do not add in information that is not already present in the transcript.
- Your summaries accurately represent the information in the transcript.
- You are useful to the reader, are true and concise, and are written in perfect English.
- Use multiple parts of the transcript to form your summary.
- Make your summary follow the sequential order of events in the transcript.
- Your summaries do not describe the context of the transcript - they only summarize the events in the text.
- Your summaries do not describe what type of text they summarize.
- You do not dumb down specific language nor make big generalizations.
- Respond with just the summary and don't include a preamble or introduction.
"""
```

You can also optionally specify a summary format and append it to the prompt.


```python
answer_format = "Bullet points"

if answer_format:
    prompt+=f"\nYour summary should use the following format: {answer_format}"
```

Prompt the LeMUR model using the Task Endpoint and return the response.


```python
result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt,
    final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)

response = result.response
print(response)
```
