title: 'How To Estimate Input Token Costs for LeMUR'
---





AssemblyAI's [LeMUR](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/lemur/) (Leveraging Large Language Models to Understand Recognized Speech) framework is a powerful way to extract insights from transcripts generated from audio and video files. Given how varied the type of input and output could be for these use cases, the [pricing](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing) for LeMUR is based on input and output tokens.

Output tokens can be controlled via LeMUR's [max_output_size](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/lemur/advanced/customize-parameters#change-the-maximum-output-size) parameter, but how do you determine the amount of input tokens you'll be sending to LeMUR? How many tokens does an audio file contain? This Colab will show you how to calculate that information to help predict LeMUR's cost ahead of time.

Here’s the full sample code for what you’ll build in this tutorial:

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

transcript = transcriber.transcribe("https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/audio-examples/raw/main/20230607_me_canadian_wildfires.mp3")
character_count = len(transcript.text)
count_in_thousands = character_count / 1000

sonnet_cost = 0.003 * count_in_thousands
opus_cost = 0.015 * count_in_thousands
haiku_cost = 0.00025 * count_in_thousands

print(f"LeMUR Claude 3.5 Sonnet | LeMUR Claude 3 Sonnet Cost: ${sonnet_cost}")
print(f"LeMUR Default | LeMUR Claude 2.1 | LeMUR Claude 3 Opus Cost: ${opus_cost}")
print(f"LeMUR Claude 3 Haiku Cost: ${haiku_cost}")
```

To get started, you'll need to install the AssemblyAI Python SDK, which we'll use to transcribe our file.


```bash
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Now we'll import these files and set our AssemblyAI API key, which can be found on your account [dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account).


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "API_KEY"
```

Next we'll transcribe our file using AssemblyAI.


```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

transcript = transcriber.transcribe("https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/audio-examples/raw/main/20230607_me_canadian_wildfires.mp3")
```

LeMUR counts tokens based solely on character count, so we'll be using Python's built-in `len()` function to count the characters in our transcript.


```python
character_count = len(transcript.text)

print(character_count)
```

For this specific file, we got 4,928 tokens. LeMUR's pricing is calculated per 1K tokens, and is prorated for amounts below this.


```python
count_in_thousands = character_count / 1000

sonnet_cost = 0.003 * count_in_thousands
opus_cost = 0.015 * count_in_thousands
haiku_cost = 0.00025 * count_in_thousands

print(f"LeMUR Claude 3.5 Sonnet | LeMUR Claude 3 Sonnet Cost: ${sonnet_cost}")
print(f"LeMUR Default | LeMUR Claude 2.1 | LeMUR Claude 3 Opus Cost: ${opus_cost}")
print(f"LeMUR Claude 3 Haiku Cost: ${haiku_cost}")
```

Here we've determined how much the input tokens from our transcript will cost with LeMUR, not including the tokens of our prompt. To calculate how much the input tokens will cost for your prompt, or how much the amount of output tokens you're limited to will cost, you can follow this same method, replacing `transcript.text` with the text of your prompt, or `num_tokens` with the `max_output_size` amount you've specified to LeMUR.
