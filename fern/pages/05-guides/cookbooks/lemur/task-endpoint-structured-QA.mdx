title: "Prompt A Structured Q&A Response Using LeMUR"
---

This Colab will demonstrate how to use AssemblyAI's [LeMUR](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/lemur/) (Leveraging Large Language Models to Understand Recognized Speech) framework to prompt a structured Question and Answer response using the Task Endpoint.

## Quickstart

```python
import assemblyai as aai
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
audio_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/meeting.mp4"

transcript = aai.Transcriber().transcribe(audio_url)

def construct_question(question):
    question_str = f"Question: {question.question}"

    if question.context:
        question_str += f"\nContext: {question.context}"

    # Set default answer_format to "short sentence" if not provided
    if not question.answer_format:
        question.answer_format = "short sentence"

    question_str += f"\nAnswer Format: {question.answer_format}"

    if question.answer_options:
        options_str = ", ".join(question.answer_options)
        question_str += f"\nOptions: {options_str}"

    return question_str + "\n"

def escape_xml_characters(xml_string):
    return xml_string.replace('&', '&amp;')

questions = [
    aai.LemurQuestion(
        question="What are the top level KPIs for engineering?",
        context="KPI stands for key performance indicator",
        answer_format="short sentence"),
    aai.LemurQuestion(
        question="How many days has it been since the data team has gotten updated metrics?",
        answer_options=["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "more than 7"]),
    aai.LemurQuestion(
        question="What are the future plans for the project?")
]

question_str = '\n'.join(construct_question(q) for q in questions)

prompt = f"""You are an expert at giving accurate answers to questions about texts.
  No preamble.
  Given the series of questions, answer the questions.
  Each question may follow up with answer format, answer options, and context for each question.
  It is critical that you follow the answer format and answer options for each question.
  When context is provided with a question, refer to it when answering the question.
  You are useful, true and concise, and write in perfect English.
  Only the question is allowed between the <question> tag. Do not include the answer format, options, or question context in your response.
  Only text is allowed between the <question> and <answer> tags.
  XML tags are not allowed between the <question> and <answer> tags.
  End your response with a closing </response> tag.
  For each question-answer pair, format your response according to the template provided below:

Template for response:
<responses>
  <response>
    <question>The question</question>
    <answer>Your answer</answer>
  </response>
  <response>
    ...
  </response>
  ...
</responses>

These are the questions:
{question_str}
"""

result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt,
    final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)

response = result.response

# Escape special XML characters and strip any leading/trailing whitespace
clean_response = escape_xml_characters(response).strip()
root = ET.fromstring(clean_response)
for response in root.findall('response'):
    question = response.find('question').text
    answer = response.find('answer').text
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

## Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard.

Find more details on the current LeMUR pricing in the AssemblyAI [pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing#:~:text=LeMUR).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

In this guide, we will prompt LeMUR with a structured Q&A format and generate an XML response.

First, let's install the AssemblyAI SDK.

```bash
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Then we'll import the SDK and set our AssemblyAI API key.

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "API_KEY_HERE"
```

Next, we'll use AssemblyAI to transcribe a file and save our transcript.

```python
audio_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/meeting.mp4"

transcript = aai.Transcriber().transcribe(audio_url)
```

Construct a formatted string to structure the questions from the `LemurQuestion` object. This includes the question text, optional context, an answer format (defaulting to "short sentence" if not provided), and any answer options, then returns the formatted string.

```python
def construct_question(question):
    question_str = f"Question: {question.question}"

    if question.context:
        question_str += f"\nContext: {question.context}"

    # Set default answer_format to "short sentence" if not provided
    if not question.answer_format:
        question.answer_format = "short sentence"

    question_str += f"\nAnswer Format: {question.answer_format}"

    if question.answer_options:
        options_str = ", ".join(question.answer_options)
        question_str += f"\nOptions: {options_str}"

    return question_str + "\n"
```

Define a list of `aai.LemurQuestion` objects. For each question, you can define additional `context` and specify either a `answer_format` or a list of `answer_options`.

```python
questions = [
    aai.LemurQuestion(
        question="What are the top level KPIs for engineering?",
        context="KPI stands for key performance indicator",
        answer_format="short sentence"),
    aai.LemurQuestion(
        question="How many days has it been since the data team has gotten updated metrics?",
        answer_options=["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "more than 7"]),
    aai.LemurQuestion(
        question="What are the future plans for the project?")
]

```

Construct the formatted question string for all the Questions within the list of `aai.LemurQuestion` objects.

```python
question_str = '\n'.join(construct_question(q) for q in questions)
```

Provide detailed instructions to prompt LeMUR to answer a series of questions. This also defines a structured XML template for the responses.

```python
prompt = f"""You are an expert at giving accurate answers to questions about texts.
  No preamble.
  Given the series of questions, answer the questions.
  Each question may follow up with answer format, answer options, and context for each question.
  It is critical that you follow the answer format and answer options for each question.
  When context is provided with a question, refer to it when answering the question.
  You are useful, true and concise, and write in perfect English.
  Only the question is allowed between the <question> tag. Do not include the answer format, options, or question context in your response.
  Only text is allowed between the <question> and <answer> tags.
  XML tags are not allowed between the <question> and <answer> tags.
  End your response with a closing </response> tag.
  For each question-answer pair, format your response according to the template provided below:

Template for response:
<responses>
  <response>
    <question>The question</question>
    <answer>Your answer</answer>
  </response>
  <response>
    ...
  </response>
  ...
</responses>

These are the questions:
{question_str}
"""
```

Prompt the LeMUR model using the Task Endpoint and return the response.

```python
result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt,
    final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)

response = result.response
print(response)
```

Clean the XML output and print the question and answer pairs.

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def escape_xml_characters(xml_string):
    return xml_string.replace('&', '&amp;')

# Escape special XML characters and strip any leading/trailing whitespace
clean_response = escape_xml_characters(response).strip()

root = ET.fromstring(clean_response)

for response in root.findall('response'):
    question = response.find('question').text
    answer = response.find('answer').text
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```
