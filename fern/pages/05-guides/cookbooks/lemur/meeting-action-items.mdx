title: 'Automatically Generate Action Items from a Meeting with LeMUR'
---





In this guide, we'll show you how to use AssemblyAI's LeMUR (Leveraging Large Language Models to Understand Recognized Speech) framework to process an audio file and then use [LeMUR's Action Items feature](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur) to automatically generate action items from the meeting's transcript.

## Quickstart

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "your_api_key"
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("./meeting.mp3")

# context is any information that would not be present in the transcript but may be helpful to know when generating action items
context = """This is a Product Team meeting from 2019-07-09. \
             These action items will be generated for meeting members as a reminder, so there is no need to be excessively detailed in the action items.
          """

# answer_format defines how you want the action items from LeMUR to be presented.
answer_format = """
                Action item title: A brief, descriptive title that summarizes the action item.
                Assignee: The person who is responsible for completing the action item.
                Due date: The deadline for completing the action item.
                Status: The current status of the action item (e.g., "In progress", "Completed", "Deferred").
                Notes: Any additional notes or information about the action item.
                """

result = transcript.lemur.action_items(context=context, answer_format=answer_format)
print(result.response)
```

## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard.

LeMUR features are currently only available to paid users at two pricing tiers: LeMUR and LeMUR Basic. Refer to [the pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing#:~:text=LeMUR) for more detail.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

In this guide, we'll submit a meeting recording to AssemblyAI's API for transcription. Then, we'll request a list of action items from LeMUR.


Import the `assemblyai` package and set your API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "your_api_key"
```

Use the `Transcriber` object's `transcribe` method and pass in the audio file's path as a parameter. The `transcribe` method will save the results of the transcription to the `Transcriber` object's `transcript` attribute.


```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("./meeting.mp3")
```

Define your LeMUR request `context` and `answer_format` parameters for the Action Items feature.


```python
# context is any information that would not be present in the transcript but may be helpful to know when generating action items
context = """This is a Product Team meeting from 2019-07-09. \
             These action items will be generated for meeting members as a reminder, so there is no need to be excessively detailed in the action items.
          """

# answer_format defines how you want the action items from LeMUR to be presented.
answer_format = """
                Action item title: A brief, descriptive title that summarizes the action item.
                Assignee: The person who is responsible for completing the action item.
                Due date: The deadline for completing the action item.
                Status: The current status of the action item (e.g., "In progress", "Completed", "Deferred").
                Notes: Any additional notes or information about the action item.
                """
```

Run the `action_items` method on `transcript` and print the result to your terminal.


```python
result = transcript.lemur.action_items(context=context, answer_format=answer_format)
print(result.response)
```

The output will look similar to the example below.
