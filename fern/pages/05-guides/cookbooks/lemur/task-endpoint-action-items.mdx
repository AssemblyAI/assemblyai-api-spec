title: 'How to Generate Action Items with LeMUR'
---





This tutorial will demonstrate how to use AssemblyAI's [LeMUR](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/lemur/) (Leveraging Large Language Models to Understand Recognized Speech) framework to create action items from a transcript using the Task endpoint.

Here’s the full sample code for what you’ll build in this tutorial:

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
audio_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/meeting.mp4"

transcript = aai.Transcriber().transcribe(audio_url)

prompt = f"""
Here are guidelines to follow:
- You are an expert at understanding transcripts of conversations, calls and meetings.
- You are an expert at coming up with ideal action items based on the contents of the transcripts.
- Action items are things that the transcript implies should get done.
- Your action item ideas do not make stuff up that isn't relevant to the transcript.
- You do not needlessly make up action items - you stick to important tasks.
- You are useful, true and concise, and write in perfect English.
- Your action items can be tied back to direct quotes in the transcript.
- You do not cite the quotes the action items relate to.
- The action items are written succinctly.
- Please give useful action items based on the transcript.

answer_format = "Bullet Points"

if answer_format:
    prompt += f"\nYour response should have the following format: {answer_format}"

result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt,
    final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)

response = result.response
print(response)
```

### Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard. You will need to upgrade your account by adding a credit card to have access to LeMUR.

Find more details on the current LeMUR pricing in the AssemblyAI [pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing#:~:text=LeMUR).

### Step-by-Step Instructions

In this guide, we will prompt LeMUR to generate action items from our transcript.

First, let's install the AssemblyAI SDK.


```bash
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Then we'll import the SDK and set our AssemblyAI API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "API_KEY"
```

Next, we'll use AssemblyAI to transcribe a file and save our transcript.


```python
audio_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/meeting.mp4"

transcript = aai.Transcriber().transcribe(audio_url)
```

Provide detailed instructions to prompt LeMUR to create action items from the transcript.


```python
prompt = f"""
Here are guidelines to follow:
- You are an expert at understanding transcripts of conversations, calls and meetings.
- You are an expert at coming up with ideal action items based on the contents of the transcripts.
- Action items are things that the transcript implies should get done.
- Your action item ideas do not make stuff up that isn't relevant to the transcript.
- You do not needlessly make up action items - you stick to important tasks.
- You are useful, true and concise, and write in perfect English.
- Your action items can be tied back to direct quotes in the transcript.
- You do not cite the quotes the action items relate to.
- The action items are written succinctly.
- Please give useful action items based on the transcript.

You can also optionally specify an action items format and append it to the prompt.


```python
answer_format = "Bullet Points"

if answer_format:
    prompt += f"\nYour response should have the following format: {answer_format}"
```

Prompt the LeMUR model using the Task Endpoint and return the response.


```python
result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt,
    final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)

response = result.response
print(response)
```
