title: "Redact PII from Text Using LeMUR"
---

This guide will show you how to use AssemblyAI's LeMUR framework to redact personally identifiable information (PII) from text.

## Quickstart

```python
import assemblyai as aai
import json
import os

aai.settings.api_key = 'YOUR API KEY'

def generate_ner(transcript_text):
    prompt = '''
    You will be given a transcript of a conversation or text. Your task is to generate named entities from the given transcript text.

    Please identify and extract the following named entities from the transcript:

    1. Person names
    2. Organization names
    3. Email addresses
    4. Phone numbers
    5. Full addresses

    When extracting these entities, make sure to return the exact spelling and formatting as they appear in the transcript. Do not modify or standardize the entities in any way.

    Present your results in a JSON format with a single field named "named_entities". This field should contain an array of strings, where each string is a named entity you've identified. For example:
    {
      "named_entities": ["John Doe", "Acme Corp", "john.doe@example.com", "123-456-7890", "123 Main St, Anytown, USA 12345"]
    }

    Important: Do not include any other information, explanations, or text in your response. Your output should consist solely of the JSON object containing the named entities.

    If you do not find any named entities of a particular type, simply return a empty array for the "named_entities" field.
    '''

    response = aai.Lemur().task(
        prompt=prompt,
        input_text=transcript_text,
        max_output_size=4000,
        temperature=0.0,
        final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
    ).response

    try:
      res_json = json.loads(response)
    except:
      res_json = {'named_entities': []}

    named_entities = res_json.get('named_entities', [])

    return named_entities

transcriber = aai.Transcriber(config=aai.TranscriptionConfig(language_code='en'))
transcript = transcriber.transcribe('YOUR_AUDIO_URL')

redacted_transcript = ''

for sentence in transcript.get_sentences():
  generated_entities = generate_ner(sentence.text)

  redacted_sentence = sentence.text

  for entity in generated_entities:
    redacted_sentence = redacted_sentence.replace(entity, '#' * len(entity))

  redacted_transcript += redacted_sentence + ' '
  print(redacted_sentence)

print('Full redacted transcript:')
print(redacted_transcript)
```

## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for an account and get your API key from your dashboard.

For information about LeMUR pricing, see our [pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the SDK.

```python
pip install assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set your API key.

```python
import assemblyai as aai
import json
import os

aai.settings.api_key = 'YOUR API KEY'
```

Define a function `generate_ner` that uses LeMUR to identify named entities (person names, organizations, emails, phone numbers, addresses) in a given text.

```python
def generate_ner(transcript_text):
    prompt = '''
    You will be given a transcript of a conversation or text. Your task is to generate named entities from the given transcript text.

    Please identify and extract the following named entities from the transcript:

    1. Person names
    2. Organization names
    3. Email addresses
    4. Phone numbers
    5. Full addresses

    When extracting these entities, make sure to return the exact spelling and formatting as they appear in the transcript. Do not modify or standardize the entities in any way.

    Present your results in a JSON format with a single field named "named_entities". This field should contain an array of strings, where each string is a named entity you've identified. For example:
    {
      "named_entities": ["John Doe", "Acme Corp", "john.doe@example.com", "123-456-7890", "123 Main St, Anytown, USA 12345"]
    }

    Important: Do not include any other information, explanations, or text in your response. Your output should consist solely of the JSON object containing the named entities.

    If you do not find any named entities of a particular type, simply return a empty array for the "named_entities" field.
    '''

    response = aai.Lemur().task(
        prompt=prompt,
        input_text=transcript_text,
        max_output_size=4000,
        temperature=0.0,
        final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
    ).response

    try:
      res_json = json.loads(response)
    except:
      res_json = {'named_entities': []}

    named_entities = res_json.get('named_entities', [])

    return named_entities
```

Transcribe an audio file using the AssemblyAI Transcriber.

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber(config=aai.TranscriptionConfig(language_code='en'))
transcript = transcriber.transcribe('YOUR_AUDIO_URL')
```

Iterate through each sentence in the transcript, identify named entities using `generate_ner`, and replace them with # characters.

```python
redacted_transcript = ''

for sentence in transcript.get_sentences():
  generated_entities = generate_ner(sentence.text)

  redacted_sentence = sentence.text

  for entity in generated_entities:
    redacted_sentence = redacted_sentence.replace(entity, '#' * len(entity))

  redacted_transcript += redacted_sentence + ' '
  print(redacted_sentence)
```

Print the redacted transcript.

```python
print('Full redacted transcript:')
print(redacted_transcript)
```
