title: 'How To Segment A Phone Call using LeMUR'
---





In this guide we will show you how to use AssemblyAI's LLM, [LeMUR](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/lemur/examples), to segment a phone call. 

Here’s the full sample code for what you’ll build in this tutorial:

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
audio_url = "YOUR_AUDIO_URL" # You can also provide a path to a local audio file

transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_url)

phases = [
    "Introduction",
    "Complaint",
    "Resolution",
    "Goodbye"
]

prompt = f'''
Analyze the following transcript of a phone call conversation and divide it into the following phases:
{', '.join(phases)}

You will be given the transcript in the format of VTT captions.

For each phase:
1. Identify the start and end timestamps (in seconds)
2. Provide a brief summary of what happened in that phase

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "phases": [
        {{
            "name": "Phase Name",
            "start_time": start_time_in_seconds,
            "end_time": end_time_in_seconds,
            "summary": "Brief summary of the phase"
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}

Ensure that all parts of the conversation are covered by a phase, using "Other" for any parts that don't fit into the specified phases.
'''

result = aai.Lemur().task(
    input_text=transcript.export_subtitles_vtt(),
    prompt=prompt,
    final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)

print(result.response)
```

## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard. You will need to upgrade your account by adding a credit card to have access to LeMUR.

Find more details on the current LeMUR pricing in the AssemblyAI [pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the SDK:


```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

Import the SDK and set your AssemblyAI API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "API_KEY"
```

Use AssemblyAI to transcribe a file and save the transcript.


```python
audio_url = "YOUR_AUDIO_URL"

transcript = aai.Transcriber().transcribe(audio_url)
```

Define the phases you want to identify. 

Here is an example of `phases` that can be used for customer support calls:


```python
phases = [
    "Introduction",
    "Complaint",
    "Resolution",
    "Goodbye"
]
```

Prompt LeMUR using the Task Endpoint, analyze the transcript to divide it into phases, and return the response. This is an example prompt, which you can modify to suit your specific requirements. See our documentation for more information about [prompt engineering](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/lemur/improving-your-prompt).


```python
prompt = f'''
Analyze the following transcript of a phone call conversation and divide it into the following phases:
{', '.join(phases)}

You will be given the transcript in the format of VTT captions.

For each phase:
1. Identify the start and end timestamps (in seconds)
2. Provide a brief summary of what happened in that phase

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "phases": [
        {{
            "name": "Phase Name",
            "start_time": start_time_in_seconds,
            "end_time": end_time_in_seconds,
            "summary": "Brief summary of the phase"
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}

Ensure that all parts of the conversation are covered by a phase, using "Other" for any parts that don't fit into the specified phases.

print(result.response)
```

Example output of the analysis of a transcript divided into phases and formatted as a JSON object:
