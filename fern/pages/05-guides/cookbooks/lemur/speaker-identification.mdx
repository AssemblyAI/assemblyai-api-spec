In this guide, you'll learn how to use AssemblyAI's API to transcribe audio, identify speakers, and infer their names using LeMUR. We'll walk through the process of configuring the transcriber, submitting a transcript to LeMUR with speaker labels, and generating a mapping of speaker names from the transcript.

This workflow will enable you to have speaker labels with the speaker's name in your transcripts instead of `Speaker A/B`.

## Before you begin

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
- An upgraded [AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup).


```python
!pip install assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` and `re` packages and set your API key:




```python
import assemblyai as aai
import re

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR-API-KEY"
```

Define a `Transcriber`, a `TranscriptionConfig` with `speaker_labels` set to `True`. Then, create a transcript.


```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

audio_url = (
    "https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/accd617c94a24787b2e0800f264b7a5e/"
)

config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(speaker_labels=True)
transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_url, config)
```

Process the transcript with speaker labels:


```python
text_with_speaker_labels = ""

for utt in transcript.utterances:
    text_with_speaker_labels += f"Speaker {utt.speaker}:\n{utt.text}\n"
```

Count the unique speakers, then create a `LemurQuestion` for each speaker. Lastly, ask LeMUR the questions, specifying `text_with_speaker_labels` as the `input_text`.


```python
# Count the number of unique speaker labels
unique_speakers = set(utterance.speaker for utterance in transcript.utterances)

questions = []
for speaker in unique_speakers:
    questions.append(
        aai.LemurQuestion(
        question=f"Who is speaker {speaker}?",
        answer_format="<First Name> <Last Name (if applicable)>")

    )

result = aai.Lemur().question(
    questions,
    input_text=text_with_speaker_labels,
    final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet,
    context="Your task is to infer the speaker's name from the speaker-labelled transcript"
)
```

Map the speaker alphabets to their names from LeMUR:


```python
speaker_mapping = {}

for qa_response in result.response:
    pattern = r"Who is speaker (\w)\?"
    match = re.search(pattern, qa_response.question)
    if match and match.group(1) not in speaker_mapping.keys():
        speaker_mapping.update({match.group(1): qa_response.answer})
```

Print the Transcript with Speaker Names:


```python
for utterance in transcript.utterances[:10]:
   speaker_name = speaker_mapping[utterance.speaker]
   print(f"{speaker_name}: {utterance.text[:50]}...")
```
