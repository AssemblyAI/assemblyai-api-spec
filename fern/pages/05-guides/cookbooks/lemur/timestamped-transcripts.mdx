# Extracting Transcript Quotes with LeMUR's Custom Text Input Parameter

This Colab will demonstrate how to use AssemblyAI's [LeMUR](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/lemur/) (Leveraging Large Language Models to Understand Recognized Speech) framework to process an audio file and find the best quotes included in it by sending in the timestamped transcript via LeMUR's `input_text` parameter.

## Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup/) for an AssemblyAI account and get your API key from your [dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account).

First, let's install the AssemblyAI SDK.


```python
%pip install -U assemblyai
```

Then we'll import the SDK and set our AssemblyAI API key.


```python
import assemblyai

assemblyai.settings.api_key = "API_KEY_HERE"
```

Next, we'll use AssemblyAI to transcribe a file and save our transcript for later use.


```python
transcriber = assemblyai.Transcriber()

transcript = transcriber.transcribe("https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/audio-examples/raw/main/20230607_me_canadian_wildfires.mp3")
```

Then we'll take the timestamped `sentences` array from our transcript and provide it to the LeMUR Q&A endpoint to extract the most engaging quotes from this transcript with their associated timestamps.


```python
result = assemblyai.Lemur().question(
    input_text=f"{[(sentence.text, sentence.start, sentence.end) for sentence in transcript.get_sentences()]}",
    final_model=assemblyai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet,
    questions=[
        {
            "question": "What are the most engaging quotes from this transcript?",
            "context": "This is a list of sentences from the transcript, with each sentence having a start and end timestamp in milliseconds.",
            "answer_format": "Exact quotes with the start and end timestamp of each sentence."
        }
    ]
)

print(result.response[0].answer)
```
