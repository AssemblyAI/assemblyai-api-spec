title: 'Pass Context from Previous LeMUR Requests'
---





This guide will demonstrate how to use AssemblyAI's [LeMUR](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/lemur/) (Leveraging Large Language Models to Understand Recognized Speech) framework to track previous LeMUR responses and pass them as additional context for future requests to build out ability to ask "follow up" questions.

<Tip> We recommend using [Claude 3 Haiku](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/lemur/customize-parameters) to reduce costs, as this can use a lot of tokens. </Tip>

## Quickstart

```python
import assemblyai

assemblyai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
transcriber = assemblyai.Transcriber()

transcript = transcriber.transcribe("https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/5_common_sports_injuries.mp3") # You can also replace this with the path to a local file

# Define the initial prompt.
initial_prompt = input("Enter the initial prompt: ")

# Apply LeMUR.
result = transcript.lemur.task(initial_prompt)

# Store result in a list.
results_list = [result.response]

print(result.response)

while True:
    user_prompt = input("Enter the next prompt (or type 'end' to stop): ")

    if user_prompt.lower() == 'end':
        print("Ending the conversation.")
        break

    context = " ".join(results_list)
    next_prompt = f"{user_prompt} (Context: {context})"

    next_result = transcript.lemur.task(next_prompt, final_model=assemblyai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet)

    results_list.append(next_result.response)

    print(next_result.response)
```

## Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup/) for an AssemblyAI account and get your API key from your [dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account).

First, let's install the AssemblyAI SDK.


```bash
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Then we'll import the SDK and set our AssemblyAI API key.


```python
import assemblyai

assemblyai.settings.api_key = "API_KEY_HERE"
```

Next, we'll use AssemblyAI to transcribe a file and save our transcript for later use.


```python
transcriber = assemblyai.Transcriber()

transcript = transcriber.transcribe("https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/5_common_sports_injuries.mp3")
```

Then we define the initial LeMUR prompt for the Task endpoint and store the first response in a list. These list values will be recalled and added to subsequent LeMUR prompts.


```python
# Step 2: Define the initial prompt.
initial_prompt = input("Enter the initial prompt: ")

# Step 3: Apply LeMUR.
result = transcript.lemur.task(initial_prompt)

# Step 4: Store result in a list.
results_list = [result.response]

print(result.response)
```

After the intitial prompt, the code will continuously prompt the user for new prompts until they decide to stop. Stop at any time by typing 'end'. Each response is collected in the `results_list` and added as context to the next user prompt. This enables an ability to recall past responses and allow follow up questions. 


```python
while True:
    user_prompt = input("Enter the next prompt (or type 'end' to stop): ")

    if user_prompt.lower() == 'end':
        print("Ending the conversation.")
        break

    context = " ".join(results_list)
    next_prompt = f"{user_prompt} (Context: {context})"

    next_result = transcript.lemur.task(next_prompt, final_model=assemblyai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet)

    results_list.append(next_result.response)

    print(next_result.response)
```

To see these results with and without the context provided from past responses, here is a comparison table.
