title: 'Calculate the Talk / Listen Ratio of Speakers'
---

This guide will show you how to use AssemblyAI's API to calculate the talk/listen ratio of speakers in a transcript. The following code uses the [Python SDK](https://github.com/AssemblyAI/assemblyai-python-sdk).

## Quickstart

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def calculate_talk_listen_ratios(transcript):
    """
    :param transcript: AssemblyAI Transcript object
    :return: Dictionary with talk time, percentage, and talk-listen ratios for each speaker
    """
    # Ensure speaker labels were enabled
    if not transcript.utterances:
        raise ValueError("Speaker labels were not enabled for this transcript.")

    speaker_talk_time = {}
    total_time = 0

    for utterance in transcript.utterances:
        speaker = f"Speaker {utterance.speaker}"
        duration = utterance.end - utterance.start

        speaker_talk_time[speaker] = speaker_talk_time.get(speaker, 0) + duration
        total_time += duration

    # Calculate percentages and ratios
    result = {}
    for speaker, talk_time in speaker_talk_time.items():
        percentage = (talk_time / total_time) * 100
        result[speaker] = {
            "talk_time_ms": talk_time,
            "percentage": round(percentage, 2)
        }

    # Calculate talk-listen ratios for each speaker against all others
    for speaker in result.keys():
        other_speakers_time = sum(talk_time for spk, talk_time in speaker_talk_time.items() if spk != speaker)
        if other_speakers_time > 0:
            ratio = speaker_talk_time[speaker] / other_speakers_time
            result[speaker]["talk_listen_ratio"] = round(ratio, 2)
        else:
            result[speaker]["talk_listen_ratio"] = None  # Handle cases with only one speaker

    return result

transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
audio_url = ("YOUR_AUDIO_URL")
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(speaker_labels=True)
transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_url, config)

talk_listen_stats = calculate_talk_listen_ratios(transcript)
print(talk_listen_stats)

```

## Get started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the SDK:

```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set the API key.

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Define a function called `calculate_talk_listen_ratios`, which will calculate the talk-listen ratios for all speakers from a transcript with speaker labels. Speaker labels must be enabled for the ratios to be calculated.

```python
def calculate_talk_listen_ratios(transcript):
    """
    :param transcript: AssemblyAI Transcript object
    :return: Dictionary with talk time, percentage, and talk-listen ratios for each speaker
    """
    # Ensure speaker labels were enabled
    if not transcript.utterances:
        raise ValueError("Speaker labels were not enabled for this transcript.")

    speaker_talk_time = {}
    total_time = 0

    for utterance in transcript.utterances:
        speaker = f"Speaker {utterance.speaker}"
        duration = utterance.end - utterance.start

        speaker_talk_time[speaker] = speaker_talk_time.get(speaker, 0) + duration
        total_time += duration

    # Calculate percentages and ratios
    result = {}
    for speaker, talk_time in speaker_talk_time.items():
        percentage = (talk_time / total_time) * 100
        result[speaker] = {
            "talk_time_ms": talk_time,
            "percentage": round(percentage, 2)
        }

    # Calculate talk-listen ratios for each speaker against all others
    for speaker in result.keys():
        other_speakers_time = sum(talk_time for spk, talk_time in speaker_talk_time.items() if spk != speaker)
        if other_speakers_time > 0:
            ratio = speaker_talk_time[speaker] / other_speakers_time
            result[speaker]["talk_listen_ratio"] = round(ratio, 2)
        else:
            result[speaker]["talk_listen_ratio"] = None  # Handle cases with only one speaker

    return result
```

Define a `transcriber`, an `audio_url` set to a link to the audio file (replace the example link that is provided with your own), and a `TranscriptionConfig` with `speaker_labels=True`. Then create a transcript which will be sent to the function `calculate_talk_listen_ratios` and print out the results.

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
audio_url = ("https://api.assemblyai-solutions.com/storage/v1/object/public/dual-channel-phone-data/Fisher_Call_Centre/audio05851.wav")
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(speaker_labels=True)
transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_url, config)

talk_listen_stats = calculate_talk_listen_ratios(transcript)
print(talk_listen_stats)
```

Example output when using the above sample audio file:

```
{'Speaker A': {'talk_time_ms': 244196, 'percentage': 42.77, 'talk_listen_ratio': 0.75}, 'Speaker B': {'talk_time_ms': 326766, 'percentage': 57.23, 'talk_listen_ratio': 1.34}}
```
