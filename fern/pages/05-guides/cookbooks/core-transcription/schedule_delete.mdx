# Schedule a DELETE request with AssemblyAI and EasyCron


This tutorial guides you through the process of scheduling a DELETE request for a transcript created with AssemblyAI's transcription service, utilizing EasyCron for scheduling.


## Setup


To get started, paste your API token into the empty string below. If you don't already have an API token, you can get one for free [here](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup).


```python
AAI_API_TOKEN = ""
```

**Make sure not to share this token with anyone** - it is a private key associated uniquely to your account.


Next, we'll install the AssemblyAI Python SDK, which will allow us to easily use LeMUR in just a few lines of code.


```python
!pip install "assemblyai"
```

Finally, import the `assemblyai` package and set your API token in the settings:


```python
import assemblyai as aai

# set the API key
aai.settings.api_key = f"{AAI_API_TOKEN}"
```

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

# transcript = transcriber.transcribe('./my-audio.mp3')
transcript = transcriber.transcribe('/content/audio.mp3')
```

Save the transcript ID


```python
transcript_id = transcript.id
```

Using this, we now construct the URL that we want our `cron` job to call.


```python
url_to_call = f"https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript/{transcript_id}"
```

## Using EasyCron's API to schedule a DELETE request


First, sign up for an account with EasyCron here. Locate your EasyCron API key [in your user dashboard.](https://www.easycron.com/user/token)

Then, paste your EasyCron API key below.


```python
EASYCRON_API_TOKEN = ""
```

Next, we will use the datetime module to generate a `cron` expression for 24 hours from now (although you can configure the `timedelta` argument to be whatever you want)


```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

# Calculate the time 24 hours from now in EasyCron's expected format
# EasyCron uses a slightly different format, but for simplicity, we'll use the standard UTC format
# and convert this into a cron expression
time_24_hours_from_now = datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(hours=24)
cron_minute = time_24_hours_from_now.minute
cron_hour = time_24_hours_from_now.hour
cron_day = time_24_hours_from_now.day
cron_month = time_24_hours_from_now.month
cron_year = time_24_hours_from_now.year

cron_expression = f'{cron_minute} {cron_hour} {cron_day} {cron_month} * {cron_year}'
```

```python
cron_expression
```

Now, we will schedule a `cron` job 24 hours from now with EasyCron to send a delete request to AssemblyAI for the transcript that we just generated.


```python
import requests

# EasyCron API endpoint for creating a new cron job
api_endpoint = 'https://www.easycron.com/rest/add'

# The data to be sent to EasyCron's API
data = {
    'token': EASYCRON_API_TOKEN,
    'url': url_to_call,
    'cron_expression': cron_expression,
    'http_method': "DELETE",
    'http_headers': f'Authorization: {AAI_API_TOKEN}',
    'timezone': 'UTC'
}

# Make the request to EasyCron's API
response = requests.post(api_endpoint, data=data)

# Print the response from EasyCron's API
print(response.text)
```

## Troubleshooting:
`Error 3: The cron expression you entered is invalid or it cannot be matched in a realitic future.`: Check that your [EasyCron account settings](https://www.easycron.com/user/edit) has UTC configured as the default timezone.
