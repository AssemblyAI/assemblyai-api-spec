title: "Optimise Slam-1 Capitalisation with post-processing"
---

This Cookbook will demonstrate how to rectify punctuation issues using AssemblyAI's Slam-1 model and post-processing.

## Quickstart

```python
import assemblyai as aai
import re

aai.settings.api_key = "<YOUR-API-KEY>"

transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

def fix_capitalization(transcript):
    text = transcript.text

    # Extract entity texts for comparison - include possible punctuation variations
    entity_texts = set()
    clean_entity_texts = set()

    for entity in transcript.entities:
        # Add the exact entity text
        entity_texts.add(entity.text)

        # Add a cleaned version without punctuation
        clean_entity = entity.text.strip(".,!?;:\"'()[]{}")
        clean_entity_texts.add(clean_entity)

        # Add versions with common punctuation for names (e.g., "Name," or "Name.")
        if entity.entity_type == "person":
            for punct in [",", ".", "!", "?", ":", ";"]:
                entity_texts.add(entity.text + punct)

    # Special words that should always remain capitalized regardless of position
    special_capitalized_words = {
        "I", "I'll", "I'm", "I'd", "I've",  # First person pronouns
        "Mrs", "Mr", "Ms", "Dr", "Prof",  # Titles
        "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday",  # Days
        "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August",
        "September", "October", "November", "December"  # Months
    }

    # Step 1: Fix sentence beginnings - capitalize first letter after period + space
    sentence_pattern = r'([.!?])\s+([a-z])'
    text = re.sub(sentence_pattern, lambda m: m.group(1) + ' ' + m.group(2).upper(), text)

    # Also capitalize the very first character of the transcript if needed
    if text and text[0].isalpha() and text[0].islower():
        text = text[0].upper() + text[1:]

    # Step 2: Fix incorrect mid-sentence capitalization
    result_words = []
    sentences = re.split(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+', text)

    for sentence in sentences:
        if not sentence:
            continue

        words = sentence.split()
        if not words:
            continue

        # Keep first word capitalization as is (we fixed it in step 1)
        result_words.append(words[0])

        # Process remaining words in the sentence
        for word in words[1:]:
            # Skip words that don't start with uppercase
            if not word or not word[0].isupper():
                result_words.append(word)
                continue

            # Keep capitalization for:
            # 1. Special capitalized words (I, I'm, Mrs., etc.)
            # 2. Entity words (proper nouns) - with or without punctuation
            # 3. Words that start with non-letter characters
            clean_word = word.strip(".,!?;:\"'()[]{}")

            if (clean_word in special_capitalized_words or
                word in entity_texts or
                clean_word in clean_entity_texts or
                any(word.startswith(entity) for entity in entity_texts) or
                not word[0].isalpha()):
                result_words.append(word)
            else:
                # Lowercase the incorrectly capitalized word
                result_words.append(word.lower())

    return " ".join(result_words)

# You can use a local filepath:
# audio_file = "./example.mp3"

# Or use a publicly-accessible URL:
audio_file = "https://assembly.ai/wildfires.mp3"

config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(speech_model=aai.SpeechModel.slam_1, entity_detection=True, keyterms_prompt=["AssemblyAI"])

transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_file, config)

if transcript.status == aai.TranscriptStatus.error:
    print(f"Transcription failed: {transcript.error}")
    exit(1)

corrected_text = fix_capitalization(transcript)
print("\nCorrected text:", corrected_text)
```

## Step-by-step guide

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for an AssemblyAI account and get your API key from your [dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account).

```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

First, we'll set up our AssemblyAI client and configure our transcription parameters. We'll enable entity detection to help preserve proper noun capitalization, and include relevant key terms for your domain.

```python
import assemblyai as aai
import re

# SETTINGS
aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR-API-KEY"
audio_file = "YOUR-AUDIO-FILE"
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

# Configure transcription with entity detection
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(
    speech_model=aai.SpeechModel.slam_1,
    entity_detection=True,
    keyterms_prompt=["Your", "Domain", "Specific", "Terms", "Here"]
)

# Transcribe the audio
transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_file, config)
```

Now we'll define a function that handles our capitalization standardization:

```python
def fix_capitalization(transcript):
    text = transcript.text

    # Define words that should always remain capitalized
    special_capitalized_words = {
        "I", "I'll", "I'm", "I'd", "I've",  # First person pronouns
        "Mrs", "Mr", "Ms", "Dr", "Prof",  # Titles
        "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday",  # Days
        "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August",
        "September", "October", "November", "December"  # Months
    }

    # Extract entity texts for comparison (proper nouns detected by AssemblyAI)
    entity_texts = set()
    for entity in transcript.entities:
        entity_texts.add(entity.text)

    # STEP 1: Process capitalized words
    words = text.split()
    for i, word in enumerate(words):
        # Skip empty words or words that don't start with uppercase letters
        if not word or not word[0].isupper() or not word[0].isalpha():
            continue

        # Clean word for comparison (remove surrounding punctuation)
        clean_word = word.strip(".,!?;:\"'()[]{}")

        # Keep capitalization for special words and entities
        if (clean_word in special_capitalized_words or
            any(entity in word for entity in entity_texts)):
            continue
        else:
            # Lowercase the first letter while preserving the rest of the word
            words[i] = word[0].lower() + word[1:]

    # Rejoin words into text
    text = " ".join(words)

    # STEP 2: Capitalize sentence beginnings
    # First capitalize the very first character of the text
    if text and text[0].isalpha() and text[0].islower():
        text = text[0].upper() + text[1:]

    # Then capitalize all letters after sentence-ending punctuation
    sentence_pattern = r'([.!?])\s+([a-z])'
    text = re.sub(sentence_pattern, lambda m: m.group(1) + ' ' + m.group(2).upper(), text)

    return text
```

Finally, we'll apply our capitalization fixes and output the standardized text:

```python
# Check for transcription success
if transcript.status == aai.TranscriptStatus.error:
    print(f"Transcription failed: {transcript.error}")
    exit(1)

# Apply capitalization fixes
corrected_text = fix_capitalization(transcript)

# Output the corrected text
print("\nStandardized text:")
print(corrected_text)

# Optionally save to file
with open("standardized_transcript.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(corrected_text)

print("\nStandardized transcript saved to standardized_transcript.txt")
```

## How the code works

Our capitalization standardization follows a two-step process:

### Step 1: Process capitalized words

The first part of our code addresses incorrectly capitalized words throughout the text:

```python
# Extract entity texts from transcript
entity_texts = set()
for entity in transcript.entities:
    entity_texts.add(entity.text)

# Process each word in the transcript
words = text.split()
for i, word in enumerate(words):
    # Skip words that don't start with uppercase
    if not word[0].isupper() or not word[0].isalpha():
        continue

    # Clean word for comparison
    clean_word = word.strip(".,!?;:\"'()[]{}")

    # Keep capitalization for special words and entity words
    if (clean_word in special_capitalized_words or
        any(entity in word for entity in entity_texts)):
        continue
    else:
        # Lowercase the first letter
        words[i] = word[0].lower() + word[1:]
```

This code:

1. Creates a set of entity texts from the transcript entities
2. Processes each word in the transcript
3. Preserves capitalization for special words (I, days, months, titles) and entity words
4. Converts other incorrectly capitalized words to lowercase

### Step 2: Capitalize sentence beginnings

The second part handles sentence capitalization:

```python
# First capitalize the very first character
if text and text[0].isalpha() and text[0].islower():
    text = text[0].upper() + text[1:]

# Then capitalize after sentence-ending punctuation
sentence_pattern = r'([.!?])\s+([a-z])'
text = re.sub(sentence_pattern, lambda m: m.group(1) + ' ' + m.group(2).upper(), text)
```

This code:

1. Ensures the first character of the entire transcript is capitalized
2. Uses a regular expression to find all instances of sentence-ending punctuation followed by a lowercase letter
3. Capitalizes the first letter of each sentence

By following these steps, your transcript text will have standardized capitalization that preserves proper nouns while correcting inconsistent mid-sentence capitalization.
