# How to Get YouTube Video Transcripts with yt-dlp

In this guide, we'll show you how to get YouTube transcripts.

For this, we use the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) library to download YouTube videos and then transcribe it with the AssemblyAI API.

`yt-dlp` is a [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) fork with additional features and fixes. It is better maintained and preferred over `youtube-dl` nowadays.

In this guide we'll show 2 different approaches:

- Option 1: Download video via CLI
- Option 2: Download video via code

Let's get started!


## Install Dependencies

Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and the [AssemblyAI Python SDK](https://github.com/AssemblyAI/assemblyai-python-sdk) via pip.


```python
!pip install -U yt-dlp
```

```python
!pip install assemblyai
```

## Option 1: Download video via CLI


In this approach we download the YouTube video via the command line and then transcribe it via the AssemblyAI API. We use the following video here:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtolixa9XTg

To download it, use the `yt-dlp` command with the following options:

- `-f m4a/bestaudio`: The format should be the best audio version in m4a format.
- `-o "%(id)s.%(ext)s"`: The output name should be the id followed by the extension. In this example, the video gets saved to "wtolixa9XTg.m4a".
- `wtolixa9XTg`: the id of the video.


```python
!yt-dlp -f m4a/bestaudio -o "%(id)s.%(ext)s" wtolixa9XTg
```

Next, set up the AssemblyAI SDK and trancribe the file. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your own key. If you don't have one, you can [sign up here](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for free.

Make sure that the path you pass to the `transcribe()` function corresponds to the saved filename.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("wtolixa9XTg.m4a")
```

```python
transcript.text
```

## Option 2: Download video via code


In this approach we download the video with a Python script instead of the command line.

You can download the file with the following code:


```python
import yt_dlp

URLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtolixa9XTg']

ydl_opts = {
    'format': 'm4a/bestaudio/best',  # The best audio version in m4a format
    'outtmpl': '%(id)s.%(ext)s',  # The output name should be the id followed by the extension
    'postprocessors': [{  # Extract audio using ffmpeg
        'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
        'preferredcodec': 'm4a',
    }]
}


with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
    error_code = ydl.download(URLS)
```

After downloading, you can again use the code from option 1 to transcribe the file:


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("wtolixa9XTg.m4a")
```
