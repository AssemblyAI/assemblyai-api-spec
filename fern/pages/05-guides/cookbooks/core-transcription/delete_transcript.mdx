title: 'Delete an AssemblyAI Transcript'
---





In this guide, we'll show you how to delete an AssemblyAI transcript. We provide a code snippet to delete single or multiple transcripts.

## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Have the `transcript_id` values you would like to delete from when you generated your transcript. You can learn how to generate a transcript using AssemblyAI [here](https://github.com/AssemblyAI/cookbook/blob/master/core-transcription/transcribe.ipynb).

Install the relevant packages. 
1. Requests


```bash
pip install requests
```

Import the `requests `package and set the API key.


```python
import requests

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Create a `Delete` transcript function. 


```python
def delete_transcript_by_id(transcript_id):
    endpoint = f"https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript/{transcript_id}"
    headers = {
        "authorization": api_key
    }
    response = requests.delete(endpoint, headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Transcript with ID {transcript_id} deleted successfully.")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to delete transcript with ID {transcript_id}. Status code: {response.status_code}")
        print(response.json())
```

Add list of `transcript_id`'s you would like to delete. 

__Note:__ _Please exercise caution when deleting transcripts, as this action can't be undone_


```python
transcript_ids = [
    "TRANSCRIPT_ID_1"
    "TRANSCRIPT_ID_2", 
    "TRANSCRIPT_ID_3"
    ]
```

Loop through the `transcript_ids` list to delete each transcript.


```python
for transcript_id in transcript_ids:
    delete_transcript_by_id(transcript_id)
```

## Conclusion
By default, AssemblyAI doesn't store a copy of the files you submit to the API for transcription. However, the transcription itself is stored in our encrypted database so that we can serve it to you and your application.

Once a transcript is deleted, all sensitive information associated with it'll be permanently deleted from our system. However, certain metadata such as the transcript ID and audio duration remain stored for billing purposes.

Note that if you delete a transcript, the audio URL will no longer be available via the historical endpoint, and the `audio_url` key will show "deleted by user".
