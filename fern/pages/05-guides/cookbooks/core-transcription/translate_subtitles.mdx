title: "Translate an AssemblyAI Subtitle Transcript"
---

In this guide, we'll show you how to translate an AssemblyAI generated subtitle transcript. We will also be using the `Googletrans` Python library to implement the Google Translate API.

## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the relevant packages.

1. AssemblyAI SDK
2. Googletrans

```bash
pip install -U assemblyai googletrans
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set the API key. Import `Translator` class from `googletrans` package.

```python
import assemblyai as aai
from googletrans import Translator

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Create a `Transcriber` object.

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
```

Create a `Translator` object.

```python
translator = Translator()
```

Use the Transcriber object's `transcribe` method and pass in the audio file's path as a parameter. The transcribe method saves the results of the transcription to the `Transcriber` object's `transcript` attribute.

```python
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("./my-audio.mp3")
```

Alternatively, you can pass in a path to an audio file saved on the internet.

```python
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("https://example.org/audio.mp3")
```

Export SRT subtitles with the `export_subtitles_srt` method. Create a `subtitle_transcript` variable to translate in the next step.

```python
subtitle_transcript = transcript.export_subtitles_srt()
```

Translate subtitle transcript to target language

```python
translation = translator.translate(subtitle_transcript, dest='es')
```

Print results

```python
print(translation.text)
```

```

```

## Conclusion

Using the subtitles and transcripts generated by AssemblyAI, we can also generate translated alternatives using other translation APIs. The implementation logic will be similar with other solutions like DeepL, Yandex Translate and many more.
