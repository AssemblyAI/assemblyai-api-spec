# Specifying a language

In this guide, we'll show you how to use the API to specify a language. This will allow you to transcribe audio files of all our Supported Languages. You can find the full list of supported languages in our [Documentation](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/concepts/supported-languages). If you are unsure about the language spoken in your file, you can use our Automatic Language Detection feature to automatically identify the dominant language in your file.

### Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the SDK.


```python
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai `package and set the API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Create a `TranscriptionConfig` with `language_code` set to your specified language code. In this example, it is set to `es` (Spanish).


```python
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(language_code='es')
```

Create a `Transcriber` object and pass in the configuration.


```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber(config=config)
```

Pass the URL or file path to `Transcriber.transcribe()`. You can access the transcript from the returned `Transcript` object.


```python
FILE_URL = "https://example.org/audio.mp3"

transcript = transcriber.transcribe(FILE_URL)
```

You can access the transcription results through the `Transcriber` object's `text` attribute.


```python
print(transcript.text)
```

### Conclusion

The language_code key can be used to specify the language of the speech in your audio file. For example, English or Spanish. For a full list of supported languages, see the [Supported Languages page](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/concepts/supported-languages).
