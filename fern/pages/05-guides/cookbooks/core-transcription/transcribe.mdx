# Transcribing an Audio File

In this guide, we'll show you how to use the API to transcribe your audio files.

You can also learn the content in this Colab from [How to Transcribe Audio Files with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTWM5WuPhlQ) on [AssemblyAI's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AssemblyAI).

### Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the SDK.


```python
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai `package and set the API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Create a `Transcriber` object.


```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
```

Use the Transcriber object's `transcribe` method and pass in the audio file's path as a parameter. The transcribe method saves the results of the transcription to the `Transcriber` object's `transcript` attribute.


```python
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("./my-audio.mp3")
```

Alternatively, you can pass in a path to an audio file saved on the internet.


```python
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("https://example.org/audio.mp3")
```

You can access the transcription results through the `Transcriber` object's `text` attribute.


```python
print(transcript.text)
```

### Conclusion

Transcription is our core API use case, and nearly all other AssemblyAI features leverage our transcription functionality. We're constantly improving and updating the [language models](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/releasing-our-new-v9-transcription-model-11-better-accuracy/) used by our [transcription engine](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/conformer-2/). Of course, higher quality audio generally produces better results.

We'd love to hear about any new integrations or solutions that you build using our transcription APIâ€”you can find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AssemblyAI) or apply to join our [Creators Program](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/introducing-assemblyai-creators-program/). You can also try out the [AssemblyAI Playground](https://www.assemblyai.com/playground/source) to experiment with our transcription features without needing to write any code! If you encounter any issues or have any questions, you can refer to our [FAQ](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/concepts/faq) or reach out to our Support team.
