title: 'Automatic Language Detection'
---





In this guide, we'll show you how to use the API to identify the dominant language spoken in an audio file and automatically route it to the appropriate model for that language.

Automatic language detection is currently supported in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch.

## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the SDK.


```python
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai `package and set the API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Create a `TranscriptionConfig` with `language_detection=True`.


```python
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(language_detection=True)
```

Create a `Transcriber` object and pass in the configuration.


```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber(config=config)
```

Pass the URL or file path to `Transcriber.transcribe()`. You can access the transcript from the returned `Transcript` object.


```python
FILE_URL = "https://example.org/audio.mp3"

transcript = transcriber.transcribe(FILE_URL)
```

You can access the transcription results through the `Transcriber` object's `text` attribute.


```python
print(transcript.text)
```

## Conclusion

The `language_detection` key can be used to automatically specify the language of the speech in your audio file. Once the transcription is completed, you can find the detected language in the response by looking at the value of the language_code key.

Keep in mind that the model needs approximately 50 seconds of spoken audio over the course of the audio to reliably identify the dominant language. Once the transcription is completed, you can find the detected language in the response by looking at the value of the language_code key.
