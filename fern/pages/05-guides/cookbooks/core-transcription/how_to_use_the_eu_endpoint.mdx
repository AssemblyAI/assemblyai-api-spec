In this guide, we'll show you how to configure your code to utilise the EU endpoint when interacting directly with the API, as well as across our SDKs.

<Info>
  Streaming is now available in EU-West via `streaming.eu.assemblyai.com`
</Info>

### Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

### Python (Requests)

The only difference here is adding the `eu.` subdomain to the base URL. Everything else in your request code stays the same:

```python
# US endpoint (default)
url = "https://api.assemblyai.com"

# EU endpoint - just change the base URL
url = "https://api.eu.assemblyai.com"
```

### Python SDK

To set the EU endpoint as the base URL when using the Python SDK, add the following line of code before setting the `Transcriber` object:

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.base_url = "https://api.eu.assemblyai.com" // Set the base URL to the EU endpoint
```

### JavaScript (Axios)

Similar to the requests library for Python, the only difference here is adding the `eu.` subdomain to the base URL as follows:

```python
// US endpoint (default)
const url = 'https://api.assemblyai.com'

// EU endpoint - just change the base URL
const url = 'https://api.eu.assemblyai.com'
```

### JavaScript SDK

To set the EU endpoint as the base URL when using the JavaScript SDK, set the `baseUrl` parameter in your AssemblyAI client as follows:

```python
import { AssemblyAI } from "assemblyai";

const client = new AssemblyAI({
  apiKey: process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: "https://api.eu.assemblyai.com"  // Set the baseUrl to the EU endpoint
});
```

## Streaming Speech-to-Text

For streaming transcription, use the EU streaming endpoint `streaming.eu.assemblyai.com`.

### Python SDK (Streaming)

To use the EU streaming endpoint with the Python SDK:

```python
import assemblyai as aai
from assemblyai.streaming.v3 import StreamingClient, StreamingClientOptions

client = StreamingClient(
    StreamingClientOptions(
        api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
        api_host="streaming.eu.assemblyai.com"  # EU streaming endpoint
    )
)
```

### JavaScript SDK (Streaming)

To use the EU streaming endpoint with the JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
import { AssemblyAI } from "assemblyai";

const client = new AssemblyAI({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
});

const transcriber = client.streaming.transcriber({
  sampleRate: 16_000,
  apiHost: "streaming.eu.assemblyai.com"  // EU streaming endpoint
});
```

### WebSocket (Direct)

When connecting directly via WebSocket, use the EU streaming base URL:

```python
# US endpoint (default)
wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/ws

# EU endpoint
wss://streaming.eu.assemblyai.com/v3/ws
```
