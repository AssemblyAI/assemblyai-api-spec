title: 'How To Use The EU Endpoint'
---








In this guide, we'll show you how to configure your code to utilise the EU endpoint when interacting directly with the API, as well as across our SDKs.


<Warning>
The EU endpoint is only available for **Async STT**.
Streaming STT and LeMUR are not currently supported.
</Warning>


### Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.



### Python (Requests)

The only difference here is adding the `eu.` subdomain to the base URL. Everything else in your request code stays the same:


```python
# US endpoint (default)
url = "https://api.assemblyai.com"

# EU endpoint - just change the base URL
url = "https://api.eu.assemblyai.com"
```

### Python SDK

To set the EU endpoint as the base URL when using the Python SDK, add the following line of code before setting the `Transcriber` object:


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.base_url = "https://api.eu.assemblyai.com" // Set the base URL to the EU endpoint
```

### Javascript (Axios)

Similar to the requests library for Python, the only difference here is adding the `eu.` subdomain to the base URL as follows:


```python
// US endpoint (default)
const url = 'https://api.assemblyai.com'

// EU endpoint - just change the base URL
const url = 'https://api.eu.assemblyai.com'
```

### Javascript SDK

To set the EU endpoint as the base URL when using the Javascript SDK, set the `baseUrl` parameter in your AssemblyAI client as follows:


```python
import { AssemblyAI } from "assemblyai";

const client = new AssemblyAI({
  apiKey: process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: "https://api.eu.assemblyai.com"  // Set the baseUrl to the EU endpoint
});
```

### Java SDK

To set the EU endpoint as the base URL when using the Java SDK, use the `custom` method from the `Environment` class in your builder pattern as follows:


```python
import com.assemblyai.api.AssemblyAI;
import com.assemblyai.api.core.Environment;

AssemblyAI aai = AssemblyAI.builder()
    .apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
    .environment(Environment.custom("https://api.eu.assemblyai.com")) // Set the environment to the EU endpoint
    .build();
```

### C# SDK

To set the EU endpoint as the base URL when using the C# SDK, set the ` BaseUrl` parameter in the `ClientOptions` object before initializing the client as follows:


```python:
using AssemblyAI;

// Create ClientOptions object
var options = new ClientOptions
{
    ApiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY")!,
    BaseUrl = "https://api.eu.assemblyai.com" // Set the base URL to the EU endpoint
};

// Initialize client with options
var client = new AssemblyAIClient(options);
```

### Go SDK

To set the EU endpoint as the base URL when using the Go SDK, specifically use the constructor `NewClientWithOptions` and use the `WithBaseURL` function to set the base URL as follows:


```python
package main

import (
    "github.com/AssemblyAI/assemblyai-go-sdk"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    apiKey := os.Getenv("ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY")

    client := assemblyai.NewClientWithOptions(
        assemblyai.WithAPIKey(apiKey),
        assemblyai.WithBaseURL("https://api.eu.assemblyai.com"), // Set the base URL to the EU endpoint
    )
}
```
