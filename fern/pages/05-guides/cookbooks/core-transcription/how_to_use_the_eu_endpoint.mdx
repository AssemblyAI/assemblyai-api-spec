title: "Select The EU Region for EU Data Residency"

In this guide, we'll show you how to configure your code to utilise the EU endpoint when interacting directly with the API, as well as across our SDKs.

<Warning>
  The EU endpoint is available for **Async STT** and **LeMUR**. **Streaming STT** is not currently supported.
</Warning>

### Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

### Python (Requests)

The only difference here is adding the `eu.` subdomain to the base URL. Everything else in your request code stays the same:

```python
# US endpoint (default)
url = "https://api.assemblyai.com"

# EU endpoint - just change the base URL
url = "https://api.eu.assemblyai.com"
```

### Python SDK

To set the EU endpoint as the base URL when using the Python SDK, add the following line of code before setting the `Transcriber` object:

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.base_url = "https://api.eu.assemblyai.com" // Set the base URL to the EU endpoint
```

### Javascript (Axios)

Similar to the requests library for Python, the only difference here is adding the `eu.` subdomain to the base URL as follows:

```python
// US endpoint (default)
const url = 'https://api.assemblyai.com'

// EU endpoint - just change the base URL
const url = 'https://api.eu.assemblyai.com'
```

### Javascript SDK

To set the EU endpoint as the base URL when using the Javascript SDK, set the `baseUrl` parameter in your AssemblyAI client as follows:

```python
import { AssemblyAI } from "assemblyai";

const client = new AssemblyAI({
  apiKey: process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: "https://api.eu.assemblyai.com"  // Set the baseUrl to the EU endpoint
});
```
