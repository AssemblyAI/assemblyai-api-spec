title: 'Using LeMUR with Streaming Speech-to-Text (STT)'
---

This script is modified to contain a global variable `conversation_data` that accumulates the transcribed text in the `on_data` function. Once the transcription session is closed, the `on_close` function sends `conversation_data` to LeMUR for analysis using LeMUR's `input_text` parameter.

## Quickstart

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR-API-KEY"

def on_open(session_opened: aai.RealtimeSessionOpened):
  "This function is called when the connection has been established."

  print("Session ID:", session_opened.session_id)

def on_data(transcript: aai.RealtimeTranscript):
  "This function is called when a new transcript has been received."

  global conversation_data

  if not transcript.text:
    return

  if isinstance(transcript, aai.RealtimeFinalTranscript):
    print(transcript.text, end="\r\n")
    conversation_data += f"{transcript.text} \n"
  else:
    print(transcript.text, end="\r")

def on_error(error: aai.RealtimeError):
  "This function is called when the connection has been closed."

  print("An error occured:", error)

def on_close():
  "This function is called when the connection has been closed."
  global conversation_data
  print("Closing Session")
  result = aai.Lemur().task(
    "You are a helpful coach. Provide an analysis of the transcript "
    "and offer areas to improve with exact quotes. Include no preamble. "
    "Start with an overall summary then get into the examples with feedback.",
    input_text=conversation_data
  )

  print(result.response)

# Create the Streaming Speech-to-Text transcriber
transcriber = aai.RealtimeTranscriber(
  on_data=on_data,
  on_error=on_error,
  sample_rate=44_100,
  on_open=on_open, # optional
  on_close=on_close, # optional
)

conversation_data = ""

# Start the connection
transcriber.connect()

# Open a microphone stream
microphone_stream = aai.extras.MicrophoneStream()

# Press CTRL+C to abort
transcriber.stream(microphone_stream)

transcriber.close()
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the AssemblyAI Python SDK. To use the microphone stream, you need to install the extras for this SDK. Mac and Linux users also need to install `portaudio` before installing the extras.


<CodeBlocks>
```bash title="Mac"
brew install portaudio

pip install "assemblyai[extras]"
```
```bash title="Linux"
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev

pip install "assemblyai[extras]"
```
</CodeBlocks>


Import the `assemblyai` package and set the API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "API_KEY"
```

Create functions to handle different events during transcription.


```python
def on_open(session_opened: aai.RealtimeSessionOpened):
    "This function is called when the connection has been established."

    print("Session ID:", session_opened.session_id)

def on_error(error: aai.RealtimeError):
    "This function is called when an error has been thrown."

    print("An error occurred:", error)
```

In our `on_data` function, we append the transcript text to the `conversation_data` variable.


```python
def on_data(transcript: aai.RealtimeTranscript):
  "This function is called when a new transcript has been received."

  global conversation_data

  if not transcript.text:
    return

  if isinstance(transcript, aai.RealtimeFinalTranscript):
    print(transcript.text, end="\r\n")
    conversation_data += f"{transcript.text} \n"
  else:
    print(transcript.text, end="\r")
```

In our `on_close` function, we send the accumulated `conversation_data` to LeMUR for analysis.

```python
def on_close():
  "This function is called when the connection has been closed."
  global conversation_data
  print("Closing Session")
  result = aai.Lemur().task(
    "You are a helpful coach. Provide an analysis of the transcript "
    "and offer areas to improve with exact quotes. Include no preamble. "
    "Start with an overall summary then get into the examples with feedback.",
    input_text=conversation_data
  )

  print(result.response)
```

Create a `RealtimeTranscriber` to set up the Streaming STT configuration.


```python
transcriber = aai.RealtimeTranscriber(
    on_data=on_data,
    on_error=on_error,
    sample_rate=44_100,
    on_open=on_open,
    on_close=on_close,
)
```

Begin the Streaming STT transcription process.


```python
# Start the connection
transcriber.connect()

# Open a microphone stream
microphone_stream = aai.extras.MicrophoneStream()

# Press Ctrl+C to abort
transcriber.stream(microphone_stream)

transcriber.close()
```
