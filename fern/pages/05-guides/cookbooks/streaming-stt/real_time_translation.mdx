title: 'Translate Streaming STT Transcripts with LeMUR'
---

In this guide, you'll learn how to implement real-time translation using AssemblyAI's Streaming model and LeMUR framework.

## Quickstart

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "API_KEY"

def on_open(session_opened: aai.RealtimeSessionOpened):
    "This function is called when the connection has been established."

    print("Session ID:", session_opened.session_id)

def on_error(error: aai.RealtimeError):
    "This function is called when an error has been thrown."

    print("An error occurred:", error)

def on_close():
    "This function is called when the connection has been closed."

    print("Closing Session")


def on_data(transcript: aai.RealtimeTranscript):
    "This function is called when a new transcript has been received."

    if not transcript.text:
        return
    
    if isinstance(transcript, aai.RealtimeFinalTranscript):
        result = aai.Lemur().task("Translate the following text into Spanish. Do not write a preamble. Just return the translated text.", input_text=transcript.text)
        print(result.response, end="\r\n")

transcriber = aai.RealtimeTranscriber(
    on_data=on_data,
    on_error=on_error,
    sample_rate=44_100,
    on_open=on_open,
    on_close=on_close,
)

# Start the connection
transcriber.connect()

# Open a microphone stream
microphone_stream = aai.extras.MicrophoneStream()

# Press Ctrl+C to abort
transcriber.stream(microphone_stream)

transcriber.close()
```


## Step-by-Step Instructions

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard. Please note that this feature is available for paid accounts only. If you're on the free plan, you'll need to upgrade.

Install the AssemblyAI Python SDK. To use the microphone stream, you need to install the extras for this SDK. Mac and Linux users also need to install `portaudio` before installing the extras.


```python
# (Mac)
brew install portaudio

# (Debian/Ubuntu)
apt install portaudio19-dev

pip install "assemblyai[extras]"
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set the API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "API_KEY"
```

Create functions to handle different events during transcription.


```python
def on_open(session_opened: aai.RealtimeSessionOpened):
    "This function is called when the connection has been established."

    print("Session ID:", session_opened.session_id)

def on_error(error: aai.RealtimeError):
    "This function is called when an error has been thrown."

    print("An error occurred:", error)

def on_close():
    "This function is called when the connection has been closed."

    print("Closing Session")
```

In our `on_data` function, we're going to call LeMUR to perform real-time translation using the Claude 3 Haiku model. Other models work just as well (if not better, in the case of 3.5 Sonnet), but Haiku has proven to be the fastest at translation tasks. Note that LeMUR does only officially support English, so your mileage may vary with how well the translations turn out.


```python
def on_data(transcript: aai.RealtimeTranscript):
    "This function is called when a new transcript has been received."

    if not transcript.text:
        return
    
    if isinstance(transcript, aai.RealtimeFinalTranscript):
        result = aai.Lemur().task(
            "Translate the following text into Spanish. Do not write a preamble. Just return the translated text.", 
            input_text=transcript.text,
            final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_haiku)
        print(result.response, end="\r\n")
```

Create a `RealtimeTranscriber` to set up the Streaming STT configuration.


```python
transcriber = aai.RealtimeTranscriber(
    on_data=on_data,
    on_error=on_error,
    sample_rate=44_100,
    on_open=on_open, # Optional
    on_close=on_close, # Optional
)
```

Begin the Streaming STT transcription process.


```python
# Start the connection
transcriber.connect()

# Open a microphone stream
microphone_stream = aai.extras.MicrophoneStream()

# Press Ctrl+C to abort
transcriber.stream(microphone_stream)

transcriber.close()
```
