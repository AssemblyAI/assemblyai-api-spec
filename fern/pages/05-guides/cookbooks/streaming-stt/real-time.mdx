# Using Streaming Speech-to-Text

AssemblyAI's Streaming Speech-to-Text (STT) service allows you to transcribe live audio streams with high accuracy and low latency. By streaming your audio data to our secure WebSocket API, you can receive transcripts back within a few hundred milliseconds, and our system continues to revise these transcripts with greater accuracy over time as more context arrives.

In this Colab, you'll learn how to establish a WebSocket connection, send audio data, and receive partial and final transcription results. Streaming Speech-to-Text (STT) requires [16-bit signed integer PCM-encoded, single-channel audio](http://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/audio%20types), matching a predefined sample rate. You can send between 100 and 2000 milliseconds of audio over a WebSocket at a time.

### Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard. Please note that this feature is available for paid accounts only. If you're on the free plan, you'll need to upgrade.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the AssemblyAI Python SDK. To use the microphone stream, you need to install the extras for this SDK. Mac and Linux users also need to install `portaudio` before installing the extras.


Import the `assemblyai` package and set the API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Create functions to handle different events during transcription.


```python
def on_open(session_opened: aai.RealtimeSessionOpened):
    "This function is called when the connection has been established."

    print("Session ID:", session_opened.session_id)

def on_data(transcript: aai.RealtimeTranscript):
    "This function is called when a new transcript has been received."

    if not transcript.text:
        return
    
    if isinstance(transcript, aai.RealtimeFinalTranscript):
        print(transcript.text, end="\r\n")
    else:
        print(transcript.text, end="\r")

def on_error(error: aai.RealtimeError):
    "This function is called when an error has been thrown."

    print("An error occurred:", error)

def on_close():
    "This function is called when the connection has been closed."

    print("Closing Session")
```

Create a `RealtimeTranscriber` to set up the Streaming STT configuration.


```python
transcriber = aai.RealtimeTranscriber(
    on_data=on_data,
    on_error=on_error,
    sample_rate=44_100,
    on_open=on_open, # Optional
    on_close=on_close, # Optional
)
```

Optional: Add up to 2,500 characters of custom vocabulary to your Streaming STT session by including the `word_boost` parameter as an optional query parameter to the `RealTimeTranscriber`.

See the Adding Custom Vocabulary section.

Begin the Streaming STT transcription process.


```python
# Start the connection
transcriber.connect()

# Open a microphone stream
microphone_stream = aai.extras.MicrophoneStream()

# Press Ctrl+C to abort
transcriber.stream(microphone_stream)

transcriber.close()
```

### Audio Requirements

The raw audio data in the `audio_data` field above must comply with a strict encoding format. This is because we don't do any transcoding to your data. We send it directly to the model for transcription to reduce latency. The encoding of your audio must be in:
- WAV PCM16
- A sample rate that matches the value of the `sample_rate` query param you supply.
- Single-channel
- 100 to 2000 milliseconds of audio per message


### Request Types

There are the types of requests that can be sent to the WebSocket API.

#### Opening a Session

When opening a session, you can pass the following query attributes to the WebSocket URL:

##### `sample_rate`

The sample rate of the streamed audio.

Example: `wss://api.assemblyai.com/v2/realtime/ws?sample_rate=16000`

##### `word_boost`

See the Adding Custom Vocabulary section.

##### `token`

See the Creating Temporary Authentication Tokens section.

#### Sending Audio

When sending audio over the WebSocket connection, you should send a JSON payload with the following parameters:
| Field | Example | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `audio_data` | `"UklGRtjIAABXQVZFZ"` | Raw audio data, base 64 encoded. This can be the raw data recorded directly from a microphone or read from an audio file. |

#### Terminating a Session
When you've completed your sessino, clients should send a JSON message with the following field.
| Field | Example | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `terminate_session` | `true` | A boolean value to communicate that you wish to end your Streaming STT session forever. |

After requesting session termination, the server will send the remaining transcript messages, followed by a [SessionTerminated message](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides/real-time-streaming-transcription#session-terminated).

### Response Types

These are the types of responses that can be received from the WebSocket API.

#### Session Start

Once your request is authorized and connection established, your client receives a `SessionBegins` message with the following JSON data:
| Field | Example | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `message_type` | `"SessionBegins"` | Describes the type of the message.
| `session_id` | `"d3e8c537-2f11-494b-b497-e59a434588bd"` | Unique identifier for the established session. |
| `expires_at` | `"2023-05-24T08:09:10.161850"` | Timestamp when this session will expire. |

#### Transcripts

Our Streaming STT pipeline uses a two-phase transcription strategy, broken into partial and final results.

#### Partial Transcripts

As you send audio data to the API, the API immediately starts responding with Partial Results. The following keys are returned from the WebSocket API.
| Field | Example | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `message_type` | `"PartialTranscript"` | Describes the type of message. |
| `audio_start` | `0` | Start time of audio sample relative to session start, in milliseconds. |
| `audio_end` | `1500` | End time of audio sample realtive to session start, in milliseconds. |
| `confidence` | `0.987190506414702` | The confidence score of the entire transcription, between 0 and 1. |
| `text` | `"there is a house in new orleans"` | The partial transcript for your audio.
| `words` | `[{"start": 0, "end": 440, "confidence": 1.0, "text": "there"}, ...]` | An array of objects, with the information for each word in the trancription text. Includes the `start`/`end` time (in milliseconds) of the word, the `confidence` score of the word, and the `text` (i.e. the word itself). |
| `created` | `"2023-05-24T08:09:10:161850"` | The timestamp for the partial transcript. |

#### Final Transcripts

After you've received your partial results, our model continues to analyze incoming audio and, when it detects the end of an "utterance" (usually a pause in speech), it'll finalize the results sent to you so far with higher accuracy, as well as add punctuation and casing to the transcription text.

The following keys are returned from the WebSocket API when Final Results are sent.
| Field | Example | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `message_type` | `"FinalTranscript"` | Describes the type of message. |
| `audio_start` | `0` | Start time of audio sample relative to session start, in milliseconds. |
| `audio-end` | `1500` | End time of audio sample relative to session start, in milliseconds. |
| `confidence` | `0.997190506414702` | The confidence score of the entire transcription, between 0 and 1. |
| `text` | `"There is a house in New Orleans"` | The final transcript for your audio. |
| `words` | `[{"start": 0, "end": 440, "confidence": 1.0, "text": "There"}, ...]` | An array of objects, with the information for each word in the transcription text. Includes the `start`/`end` time (in milliseconds) of the word, the `confidence` score of the word, and the `text` (i.e. the word itself). |
| `created` | `"2023-05-24T08:09:10:161850"` | The timestamp for the final transcript.
| `punctuated` | `true` | Whether the text has been punctuated and cased. |
| `text_formatted` | `true` | Whether the text has been formatted (e.g. Dollar -> $) |

#### Session Terminated

After requesting session termination, the server will send the remaining transcript messages, followed by a `SessionTerminated` message. Your client receives a `SessionTerminated` message with the following JSON data:
| Field | Example | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `message_type` | `"SessionTerminated"` | Describes the type of the message. |

### Closing and Status Codes

The WebSocket specification provides [standard errors](https://github.com/Luka967/websocket-close-codes).

Our API provides application-level WebSocket errors for well-known scenarios.
| Error Condition | Status Code | Message |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| bad sample rate | `4000` | "Sample rate must be a positive integer" |
| auth failed | `4001` | "Not Authorized" |
| insufficient funds | `4002` | "Insufficient Funds" |
| free tier user | `4002` | "This feature is paid-only and requires you to add a credit card. Please visit https://app.assemblyai.com/ to add a credit card to your account." |
| attempt to connect to nonexistent session id | `4004` | "Session not found" |
| session expired | `4008` | "Session Expired" |
| attempt to connect to closed session | `4010` | "Session previously closed" |
| rate limited | `4029` | "Client sent audio too fast" |
| unique session violation | `4030` | "Session is handled by another WebSocket" |
| session times out | `4031` | "Session idle for too long" |
| audio too short | `4032` | "Audio duration is too short" |
| audio too long | `4033` | "Audio duration is too long" |
| bad json | `4100` | "Endpoint received invalid JSON" |
| bad schema | `4101` | "Endpoint received a message with an invalid schema" |
| too many streams | `4102` | "This account has exceeded the number of allowed streams" |
| reconnected | `4103` | "This session has been reconnected. This WebSocket is no longer valid." |
| reconnected attempts exhausted | `1013` | "Temporary server condition forced blocking client's request" |

### Quotas and Limits

The following limits are imposed to ensure performance and service quality.
- **Idle Sessions** - Sessions that don't receive audio within 1 minute will be terminated.
- **Session Limit** - 32 sessions at a time for paid users. Please contact us if you need to increase this limit. Free-tier users must upgrade their account to use Streaming STT.
- **Session Uniqueness** - Only one WebSocket per session.
- **Audio Sampling Rate Limit** - Customers must send data in near real-time. If a client sends data faster than 1 second of audio per second for longer than 1 minute, we'll terminate the session.

### Using Custom Vocabulary

Developers can also add up to 2500 characters of custom vocabulary to their Streaming STT session by adding the optional query parameter `word_boost` in the URL. The parameter should map to a JSON encoded list of strings as shown in this Python example:



```python
import json
from urllib.parse import urlencode

sample_rate = 16000
word_boost = ["foo", "bar"]
params = {"sample_rate": sample_rate, "word_boost": json.dumps(word_boost)}

url = f"wss://api.assemblyai.com/v2/realtime/ws?{urlencode(params)}"
```

### Creating Temporary Authentication Tokens

In some cases, a developer needs to authenticate on the client-side and doesn't want to expose their AssemblyAI API key. You can do this by sending a `POST` request to `https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/realtime/token` with the parameter `expires_in: {TTL in seconds}`. Below is a quick example in curl.

Note: The `expires_in` parameter must be greater than or equal to 60 seconds.


In response you'll receive the following JSON output:


```
{
  "token": "b2e3c6c71d450589b2f4f0bb1ac4efd2d5e55b1f926e552e02fc0cc070eaedbd"
}
```

A developer can now use this temporary token in the browser to authenticate a new WebSocket session with the following endpoint `wss://api.assemblyai.com/v2/realtime/ws?sample_rate=16000&token={New Temp Token}`. For example:


```python
let socket
const token = 'b2e3c6c71d450589b2f4f0bb1ac4efd2d5e55b1f926e552e02fc0cc070eaedbd'

socket = new WebSocket(
    `wss://api.assemblyai.com/v2/realtime/ws?sample_rate=16000&token=${token}`
)
```
