title: "Terminate Streaming Session After Inactivity"
---

An often-overlooked aspect of implementing AssemblyAI's Streaming Speech-to-Text (STT) service is efficiently terminating transcription sessions. In this cookbook, you will learn how to terminate a Streaming session after any fixed duration of silence.

For the full code, refer to this [GitHub gist.](https://gist.github.com/m-ods/133f7c7e4c08abf97ae53dc7577cadf7)

## Quickstart

```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Type

import assemblyai as aai
from assemblyai.streaming.v3 import (
    BeginEvent,
    StreamingClient,
    StreamingClientOptions,
    StreamingError,
    StreamingEvents,
    StreamingParameters,
    StreamingSessionParameters,
    TerminationEvent,
    TurnEvent,
)

api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

last_transcript_received = datetime.now()
terminated = False


def on_begin(self: Type[StreamingClient], event: BeginEvent):
    print(f"Session started: {event.id}")


def on_turn(self: Type[StreamingClient], event: TurnEvent):
    global last_transcript_received, terminated

    if terminated:
        return

    print(f"{event.transcript} ({event.end_of_turn})")

    if event.transcript.strip():
        last_transcript_received = datetime.now()

    silence_duration = (datetime.now() - last_transcript_received).total_seconds()
    if silence_duration > 5:
        print("No transcription received in 5 seconds. Terminating session...")
        self.disconnect(terminate=True)
        terminated = True
        return

    if event.end_of_turn and not event.turn_is_formatted:
        self.set_params(StreamingSessionParameters(formatted_finals=True))


def on_terminated(self: Type[StreamingClient], event: TerminationEvent):
    print(f"Session terminated after {event.audio_duration_seconds:.2f} seconds")


def on_error(self: Type[StreamingClient], error: StreamingError):
    print(f"Error occurred: {error}")


def main():
    client = StreamingClient(
        StreamingClientOptions(
            api_key=api_key,
            api_host="streaming.assemblyai.com",
        )
    )

    client.on(StreamingEvents.Begin, on_begin)
    client.on(StreamingEvents.Turn, on_turn)
    client.on(StreamingEvents.Termination, on_terminated)
    client.on(StreamingEvents.Error, on_error)

    client.connect(
        StreamingParameters(
            sample_rate=16000,
            formatted_finals=True,
        )
    )

    try:
        client.stream(aai.extras.MicrophoneStream(sample_rate=16000))
    finally:
        if not terminated:
            client.disconnect(terminate=True)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-step instructions

First, install AssemblyAI's Python SDK.

```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

```python
ickstart
import logging
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Type
import assemblyai as aai
from assemblyai.streaming.v3 import (
    BeginEvent,
    StreamingClient,
    StreamingClientOptions,
    StreamingError,
    StreamingEvents,
    StreamingParameters,
    StreamingSessionParameters,
    TerminationEvent,
    TurnEvent,
)
api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

## Implementing Speech Activity Checks

Our Streaming API emits a Turn Event each time speech is processed. During periods of silence, no TurnEvent will be sent. You can use this behavior to detect inactivity and automatically terminate the session.


We can track the timestamp of the most recent non-empty transcript using a datetime. On every Turn Event, we:

* Update the timestamp if meaningful speech is received

* Check how many seconds have passed since the last valid transcript

* If that exceeds your timeout (e.g. 5 seconds), terminate the session

### Key Variables

```python
last_transcript_received = datetime.now()
terminated = False
```

These are updated on every turn event.

### Turn event logic

```python
def on_turn(self: Type[StreamingClient], event: TurnEvent):
    global last_transcript_received, terminated

    if terminated:
        return

    print(f"{event.transcript} ({event.end_of_turn})")

    if event.transcript.strip():
        last_transcript_received = datetime.now()

    silence_duration = (datetime.now() - last_transcript_received).total_seconds()
    if silence_duration > 5:
        print("No transcription received in 5 seconds. Terminating session...")
        self.disconnect(terminate=True)
        terminated = True
        return

    if event.end_of_turn and not event.turn_is_formatted:
        self.set_params(StreamingSessionParameters(formatted_finals=True))
```

This pattern ensures sessions are cleanly terminated after inactivity.

## What You’ll Observe

* Live transcription continues as long as there’s speech

* After 5 seconds of silence, the session ends automatically

You can change the timeout value to suit your needs by modifying the `silence_duration` > 5 check.
