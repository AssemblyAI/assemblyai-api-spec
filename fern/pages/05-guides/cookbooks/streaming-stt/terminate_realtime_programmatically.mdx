title: "Terminate Streaming Session After Inactivity"
---

An often-overlooked aspect of implementing AssemblyAI's Streaming Speech-to-Text (STT) service is efficiently terminating transcription sessions. In this cookbook, you will learn how to terminate a Streaming session after any fixed duration of silence.

For the full code, refer to this [GitHub gist.](https://gist.github.com/m-ods/133f7c7e4c08abf97ae53dc7577cadf7)

## Quickstart

```python
import assemblyai as aai
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def on_open(session_opened: aai.RealtimeSessionOpened):
  # This function is called when the connection has been established.

  print("Session ID:", session_opened.session_id)

def on_error(error: aai.RealtimeError):
  # This function is called when the connection has been closed.

  print("An error occured:", error)

last_transcript_received = datetime.now()
terminated = False

def on_data(transcript: aai.RealtimeTranscript):
    global last_transcript_received
    global terminated

    if terminated:
        return

    if transcript.text == "":
        # You can set the total_seconds of inactivity to be higher or lower
        if (datetime.now() - last_transcript_received).total_seconds() > 5:
            print("5 seconds without new transcription, terminating...")
            terminate_transcription()
        return

    if isinstance(transcript, aai.RealtimeFinalTranscript):
        print(transcript.text, end="\r\n")
    else:
        print(transcript.text, end="\r")

    last_transcript_received = datetime.now()

def on_close():
    global terminated
    if not terminated:
        print("Closing Session")
        terminated = True

def terminate_transcription():
    global terminated
    if not terminated:
        transcriber.close()
        terminated = True

# Create the Streaming STT transcriber
transcriber = aai.RealtimeTranscriber(
  on_data=on_data,
  on_error=on_error,
  sample_rate=44_100,
  on_open=on_open, # optional
  on_close=on_close, # optional
)

# Start the connection
transcriber.connect()

# Open a microphone stream
microphone_stream = aai.extras.MicrophoneStream()

# Press CTRL+C to abort
transcriber.stream(microphone_stream)
```

## Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard.

## Step-by-step instructions

First, install AssemblyAI's Python SDK.

```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

```python
import assemblyai as aai
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Handling inactivity

### Empty transcripts

As long as a session is open, our Streaming STT service will continue sending empty `PartialTranscript`s that look like this:

Message 1:

```
{"message_type":"PartialTranscript", "created":"2023-11-10T16:10:22.754985",
"text":"", ...}
```

Message 2:

```
{"message_type":"PartialTranscript", "created":"2023-11-10T16:10:25.297511",
"text":"", ...}
```

Thus, we can use empty partial transcripts to assume that the user has stopped speaking.

Note: Other keys in the payload have been omitted for brevity but can be seen [here in our Streaming API Reference. ](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming)

## Implementing Partial Transcript Checks

Let's consider a code example to track if the `PartialTranscript`s have been empty for a duration of time.

Define your Streaming functions as per normal.

```python
def on_open(session_opened: aai.RealtimeSessionOpened):
  # This function is called when the connection has been established.

  print("Session ID:", session_opened.session_id)

def on_error(error: aai.RealtimeError):
  # This function is called when the connection has been closed.

  print("An error occured:", error)
```

Then, define the constant `last_transcript_received = datetime.now()`, and set a flag `terminated` to be `False`.

We will use these variables later on.

```python
last_transcript_received = datetime.now()
terminated = False

```

Next, define your `on_data` function:

- Access the global variable `last_transcript_received`, as well as `terminated`
- If the Streaming STT transcriber has been terminated, don't return anything.
- If `transcript.text` is empty, check if it has been 5 seconds since the last empty transcript. When `true`, terminate the transcriber.
- Else, just print the text in our terminal as per usual, and set the time of the last transcript received to now.

```python
def on_data(transcript: aai.RealtimeTranscript):
    global last_transcript_received
    global terminated

    if terminated:
        return

    if transcript.text == "":
        # You can set the total_seconds of inactivity to be higher or lower
        if (datetime.now() - last_transcript_received).total_seconds() > 5:
            print("5 seconds without new transcription, terminating...")
            terminate_transcription()
        return

    if isinstance(transcript, aai.RealtimeFinalTranscript):
        print(transcript.text, end="\r\n")
    else:
        print(transcript.text, end="\r")

    last_transcript_received = datetime.now()
```

Lastly, we define our `on_close` and `terminate_transcription` function. `on_close` simply sets `terminated` to `true` when the websocket connection closes.

`terminate_transcription` just accesses the global transcriber and closes the session when the function is called by `on_data`.

```python
def on_close():
    global terminated
    if not terminated:
        print("Closing Session")
        terminated = True

def terminate_transcription():
    global terminated
    if not terminated:
        transcriber.close()
        terminated = True
```

Create your Streaming STT transcriber and start your transcription.

```python
# Create the Streaming STT transcriber
transcriber = aai.RealtimeTranscriber(
  on_data=on_data,
  on_error=on_error,
  sample_rate=44_100,
  on_open=on_open, # optional
  on_close=on_close, # optional
)

# Start the connection
transcriber.connect()

# Open a microphone stream
microphone_stream = aai.extras.MicrophoneStream()

# Press CTRL+C to abort
transcriber.stream(microphone_stream)
```

What you should observe is that transcription works in real-time and automatically terminates after 5 seconds!
