# Applying Noise Reduction to Audio for Streaming speech-to-text


This guide demonstrates how to implement a noise reduction system for real-time audio transcription using AssemblyAI's Streaming STT and the `noisereduce` library. You'll learn how to create a custom audio stream that preprocesses incoming audio to remove background noise before it reaches the transcription service.

This solution is particularly valuable for:
- Voice assistants operating in noisy environments
- Customer service applications processing calls
- Meeting transcription tools
- Voice-enabled applications requiring high accuracy

The implementation uses Python and combines proven audio processing techniques with AssemblyAI's powerful transcription capabilities. While our example focuses on microphone input, the principles can be applied to any real-time audio stream.


## Setup


First, install the following packages: assemblyai, noisereduce, numpy


```bash
pip install assemblyai noisereduce numpy
```

```python
import assemblyai as aai
import noisereduce as nr
import numpy as np
```

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can sign up for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard. Please note that Streaming Speech-to-text is available for upgraded accounts only. If you're on the free plan, you'll need to upgrade your account by adding a credit card.


```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR-API-KEY"
```

**Make sure not to share this token with anyone** - it is a private key associated uniquely to your account.


Create functions to handle different events during transcription.


```python
def on_open(session_opened: aai.RealtimeSessionOpened):
    print("Session ID:", session_opened.session_id)

def on_data(transcript: aai.RealtimeTranscript):
    if not transcript.text:
        return
    if isinstance(transcript, aai.RealtimeFinalTranscript):
        print(transcript.text, end="\r\n")
    else:
        print(transcript.text, end="\r")

def on_error(error: aai.RealtimeError):
    print("An error occurred:", error)

def on_close():
    print("Closing Session")
```

Create a custom stream class that includes noise reduction.


```python
class NoiseReducedMicrophoneStream:
    def __init__(self, sample_rate):
        self.microphone_stream = aai.extras.MicrophoneStream(sample_rate=sample_rate)
        self.sample_rate = sample_rate
        self.buffer = np.array([])
        self.buffer_size = int(sample_rate * 0.5)  # 0.5 seconds buffer

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        # Get audio chunk from microphone
        audio_chunk = next(self.microphone_stream)

        # Convert bytes to numpy array
        audio_data = np.frombuffer(audio_chunk, dtype=np.int16)

        # Add to buffer
        self.buffer = np.append(self.buffer, audio_data)

        # Process when buffer is full
        if len(self.buffer) >= self.buffer_size:
            # Convert to float32 for noise reduction
            float_buffer = self.buffer.astype(np.float32) / 32768.0

            # Apply noise reduction
            # You can tweak these parameters to change the aggressiveness of the noise reduction
            reduced_noise = nr.reduce_noise(
                y=float_buffer,
                sr=self.sample_rate,
                prop_decrease=0.75,
                n_fft=1024
            )

            # Convert back to int16
            processed_chunk = (reduced_noise * 32768.0).astype(np.int16)

            # Clear buffer but keep a small overlap
            overlap = 1024
            self.buffer = self.buffer[-overlap:] if len(self.buffer) > overlap else np.array([])

            # Convert back to bytes
            return processed_chunk.tobytes()

        # If buffer not full, return empty bytes
        return b''
```

Now we create our transcriber and `NoiseReducedMicrophoneStream`.


```python

transcriber = aai.RealtimeTranscriber(
    sample_rate=16_000,
    on_data=on_data,
    on_error=on_error,
    on_open=on_open,
    on_close=on_close,
)

transcriber.connect()

# Use the noise-reduced stream instead of the regular microphone stream
noise_reduced_stream = NoiseReducedMicrophoneStream(sample_rate=16_000)
transcriber.stream(noise_reduced_stream)

transcriber.close()
```

You can press Ctrl+C to stop the transcription.
