# Creating Summarized Chapters from Podcasts

The [Auto Chapters](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/models/auto-chapters) model summarizes audio data over time into chapters. Chapters makes it easy for users to navigate and find specific information. Each chapter contains the following:
- Summary
- One-line gist
- Headline
- Start and end timestamps

In this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to apply the model. You'll send the `auto_chapters` parameter in your request, and then use the `chapters` property from the response.

You can also learn the content in this guide from [Automatic Chapter Detection With AssemblyAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvfmDGin7Zs) on [AssemblyAI's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AssemblyAI).

### Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up]() for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

Here's an audio example for this guide:


### Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the SDK.


```python
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set the API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai
aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Create a `TranscriptionConfig` with `auto_chapters` set to `True`.


```python
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(auto_chapters=True)
```

Create a `Transcriber` object and pass in the configuration.


```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber(config=config)
```

Pass the URL or file path to `Transcriber.transcribe()`. You can access the transcript from the returned `Transcript` object.


```python
FILE_URL = "https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/audio-examples/raw/main/20230607_me_canadian_wildfires.mp3"

transcript = transcriber.transcribe(FILE_URL)
```

You can access the chapter results from the `chapters` attriute in the transcript.


```python
for chapter in transcript.chapters:
   print("Chapter Start Time:", chapter.start)
   print("Chapter End Time:", chapter.end)
   print("Chapter Gist:", chapter.gist)
   print("Chapter Headline:", chapter.headline)
   print("Chapter Summary:", chapter.summary)

```

### Understanding the Response

Your automatic chapters are located in the `chapters` key of the API response. Each entry contains a `summary` of the chapter, a one-list `gist` and a chapter `headline`, and `start` and `end` timestamps.

```
{
    chapters:[
        0:{
            summary:"Data science and machine learning may be an even easier entree i ...",
            gist:"Learning to Code in a Machine Learning World",
            headline:"You think it's possible that machine learning becomes kind of si ...",
            start:170,
            end:101674
        },
        1:{
            summary:"Why do you like using a marker and whiteboard, even on the bigge ...",
            gist:"Using a whiteboard in talks",
            headline:"Some of your talks involve the whiteboard. Why do you like using ...",
            start:101792,
            end:186246
        }
    ]
}
```

### Conclusion

Creating text summaries using our [Auto Chapters](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/introducing-assemblyai-auto-chapters-summarize-audio-and-video-files/) functionality works on all kinds of different input sources, not just podcasts. For example, you can use it to [summarize lecture videos](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/python-project-lecture-summaries/) or other long-form content.

If you need more fine-grained control than Auto Chapters offers, you can use AssemblyAI's [Summarization model](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/models/summarization) to control the complexity of your summary.
