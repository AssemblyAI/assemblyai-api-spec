# Identifying Highlights in Audio and Video Files

The [Key Phrases](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/models/key-phrases) model identifies significant words and phrases in your transcript and lets you extract the most important concepts or highlights from your audio or video file.

For example, if you're a call center, you can analyze highlights from recorded phone calls.

In this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to apply the model. You'll send the `auto_highlights` parameter in your request, and then use the `auto_highlights_result` property in the response.

### Get Started

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

Here's an audio sample for this guide:


### Step-by-Step Instructions

Install the SDK.


```python
pip install -U assemblyai
```

Import the `assemblyai` package and set the API key.


```python
import assemblyai as aai
aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY'"
```

Create a `TranscriptionConfig` with `auto_highlights` set to `True`.


```python
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(auto_highlights=True)
```

Create a `Transcriber` object and pass in the configuration.


```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber(config=config)
```

Pass the URL or file path to `Transcriber.transcribe()`. You can access the transcript from the returned `Transcript` object.


```python
FILE_URL = "https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/audio-examples/raw/main/20230607_me_canadian_wildfires.mp3"

transcript = transcriber.transcribe(FILE_URL)
```

You can access automatic hightlights from `transcript.auto_highlights.result`.


```python
for result in transcript.auto_highlights.results:
    print(f"Highlight: {result.text}, Count: {result.count}, Rank: {result.rank}, Timestamps: {result.timestamps}")
```

### Sort highlights by timestamps

By default, the highlights are sorted by rank, with the highlight with the highest rank being the first.

If you want to sort the highlights by timestamps, you can use the built-in [sorted](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) function in Python with the `key` argument being the `start` attribute of the highlight's first timestamp.


```python
key_phrases = transcript.auto_highlights.results

key_phrases = sorted(key_phrases, key=lambda x: x.timestamps[0].start)

for result in key_phrases:
    print(f"Highlight: {result.text}, Count: {result.count}, Rank: {result.rank}, Timestamps: {result.timestamps}")
```

### Understanding the Response

The `auto_highlights_result` key in the response contains a list of all the highlights found int the transcription text. For each entry, the results include the text of the phrase or word detected (`text`), how many times it occurred in the text (`count`), its relevancy score (`rank`), and a list of all the timestamps (`timestamps`), in milliseconds, in the audio where the phrase or word is spoken.
```
{
    auto_highlights_result:{
        status:"success",
        results:[
            0:{
                count:2,
                rank:0.04,
                text:"months",
                timestamps:[
                    0:{
                        start:24688,
                        end:24922
                    },
                    1:{
                        start:80408,
                        end:80594
                    }
                ]
            },
            1:{
                count:1,
                rank:0.04,
                text:"first fee",
                timestamps:[
                    0:{
                        start:78948,
                        end:79766
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    auto_highlights:true
}
```

### Conclusion

Automatically highlighting relevant phrases in calls is a great way to focus on important information at a glance. In general, adding AI to Conversation Intelligence tools can augment them by generating actionable summaries to speed up call review, generating insights, monitoring for concerns, increasing engagement, and [more](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/3-easy-ways-to-add-ai-summarization-to-conversation-intelligence-tools/). Our AI summarization model has several [customizable parameters](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/models/summarization#types-and-models) that you can experiment with for other types of recordings.
