<Warning title="Deprecation Notice">
  As of April 2025, AssemblyAI Go SDK has been discontinued and will no longer be maintained. While the SDK will no longer be updated, any previously published releases will remain available.

Going forward, see the [API Reference Guide](/docs/api-reference/overview) for information on how to integrate with our API directly.

We know this is a disruptive change. If you need help with this transition, reach out to our Support team at support@assemblyai.com and we'll help you in any way we can.

# AssemblyAI Go SDK

A Go client library for accessing [AssemblyAI](https://assemblyai.com).

## Quickstart

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/AssemblyAI/assemblyai-go-sdk
```

## Tips and tricks

### Inspect API errors

If you receive an API error, you can inspect the HTTP response returned by the API for more details:

```go
transcript, err := client.Transcripts.TranscribeFromURL(ctx, audioURL, nil)
if err != nil {
    var apierr aai.APIError
    if errors.As(err, &apierr) {
        // apierr.Response is the *http.Response from the API call.
        fmt.Println(apierr.Response.StatusCode)
    } else {
        // err is not an API error.
    }
}
```
