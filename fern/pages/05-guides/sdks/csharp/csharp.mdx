<Warning title="Deprecation Notice">
  As of April 2025, AssemblyAI C# SDK has been discontinued and will no longer be maintained. While the SDK will no longer be updated, any previously published releases will remain available.

  Going forward, see the [C# Pre-Recorded Audio page](/docs/getting-started/transcribe-an-audio-file/csharp) for information on how to integrate with our API directly.

  We know this is a disruptive change. If you need help with this transition, reach out to our Support team at support@assemblyai.com and we'll help you in any way we can.
</Warning>

## Installation

You can find the `AssemblyAI` C# SDK on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AssemblyAI).
Add the latest version using the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package AssemblyAI
```

Then, create an AssemblyAIClient with your API key:

```csharp
using AssemblyAI;

var client = new AssemblyAIClient(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY")!);
```

You can now use the `client` object to interact with the AssemblyAI API.

## Add the AssemblyAIClient to the dependency injection container

The AssemblyAI SDK has built-in support for default .NET dependency injection container.
Add the `AssemblyAIClient` to the service collection like this:

```csharp
using AssemblyAI;

// build your services
services.AddAssemblyAIClient();

```

By default, the `AssemblyAIClient` loads it configuration from the `AssemblyAI` section from the .NET configuration.

```json
{
  "AssemblyAI": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

You can also configure the `AssemblyAIClient` other ways using the `AddAssemblyAIClient` overloads.

```csharp
using AssemblyAI;

// build your services
services.AddAssemblyAIClient(options =>
{
    options.ApiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY")!;
});
```
