<Warning title="Deprecation Notice">

As of April 2025, AssemblyAI C# SDK has been discontinued and will no longer be maintained. While the SDK will no longer be updated, any previously published releases will remain available.

Going forward, see the [LeMUR page](/docs/lemur/apply-llms-to-audio-files) for information on how to integrate with our API directly.

We know this is a disruptive change. If you need help with this transition, reach out to our Support team at support@assemblyai.com and we'll help you in any way we can.

# LeMUR

## Summarize your audio data

```csharp
using AssemblyAI;
using AssemblyAI.Lemur;
using AssemblyAI.Transcripts;

var client = new AssemblyAIClient("<YOUR_API_KEY>");

// You can use a local file:
/*
var transcript = await client.Transcripts.TranscribeAsync(
    new FileInfo("./example.mp3")
);
*/

// Or use a publicly-accessible URL:
const string audioUrl = "https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3";
var transcript = await client.Transcripts.TranscribeAsync(new TranscriptParams
{
    AudioUrl = audioUrl
});

var lemurTaskParams = new LemurTaskParams
{
    Prompt = "Provide a brief summary of the transcript.",
    TranscriptIds = [transcript.Id],
    FinalModel = LemurModel.AnthropicClaude3_5_Sonnet
};

var response = await client.Lemur.TaskAsync(lemurTaskParams);

Console.WriteLine(response.Response);
```

If you run the code above, you'll see the following output:

```plain
The transcript describes several common sports injuries - runner's knee,
sprained ankle, meniscus tear, rotator cuff tear, and ACL tear. It provides
definitions, causes, and symptoms for each injury. The transcript seems to be
narrating sports footage and describing injuries as they occur to the athletes.
Overall, it provides an overview of these common sports injuries that can result
from overuse or sudden trauma during athletic activities
```

## Ask questions about your audio data

**Q&A with the task endpoint**

To ask question about your audio data, define a prompt with your questions and call `client.Lemur.TaskAsync()`. Use the `TranscriptIds` parameter to send one or more transcripts as additional context for the model.

```csharp {13-14,16-22}
using AssemblyAI;
using AssemblyAI.Lemur;
using AssemblyAI.Transcripts;

var client = new AssemblyAIClient("<YOUR_API_KEY>");

// Step 1: Transcribe an audio file. For local files see our Getting Started guides.
var transcript = await client.Transcripts.TranscribeAsync(new TranscriptParams
{
    AudioUrl = "https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3"
});

// Step 2: Define a prompt with your question(s).
const string prompt = "What is a runner's knee?";

// Step 3: Apply LeMUR.
var lemurTaskParams = new LemurTaskParams
{
    Prompt = prompt,
    TranscriptIds = [transcript.Id],
    FinalModel = LemurModel.AnthropicClaude3_5_Sonnet
};

var response = await client.Lemur.TaskAsync(lemurTaskParams);

Console.WriteLine(response.Response);
```

#**Example output**

```plain
Based on the transcript, runner's knee is a condition characterized
by pain behind or around the kneecap. It is caused by overuse,
muscle imbalance and inadequate stretching. Symptoms include pain
under or around the kneecap and pain when walking.
```

**Q&A with the question-answer endpoint**

The [LeMUR Question & Answer function](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur/question-answer) requires no prompt engineering and facilitates more deterministic and structured outputs. See the code examples below for more information on how to use this endpoint.

To use it, define a list of `LemurQuestion` objects. For each question, you can define additional `Context` and specify either a `AnswerFormat` or a list of `AnswerOptions`. Additionally, you can define an overall `Context`.

```csharp {12-32}
using AssemblyAI;
using AssemblyAI.Lemur;
using AssemblyAI.Transcripts;

var client = new AssemblyAIClient("<YOUR_API_KEY>");

var transcript = await client.Transcripts.TranscribeAsync(new TranscriptParams
{
    AudioUrl = "https://assembly.ai/meeting.mp4"
});

var lemurTaskParams = new LemurQuestionAnswerParams
{
    TranscriptIds = [transcript.Id],
    FinalModel = LemurModel.AnthropicClaude3_5_Sonnet,
    Context = "A GitLab meeting to discuss logistic",
    Questions =
    [
        new LemurQuestion
        {
            Question = "What are the top level KPIs for engineering?",
            Context = "KPI stands for key performance indicator",
            AnswerFormat = "short sentence"
        },
        new LemurQuestion
        {
            Question = "How many days has it been since the data team has gotten updated metrics?",
            Context = "KPI stands for key performance indicator",
            AnswerOptions = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "more than 7"]
        }
    ]
};

var response = await client.Lemur.QuestionAnswerAsync(lemurTaskParams);

foreach (var qa in response.Response)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Question: {qa.Question}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Answer: {qa.Answer}");
}
```

## Change the model type

LeMUR features the following LLMs:

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Claude 3 Opus
- Claude 3 Haiku
- Claude 3 Sonnet

You can switch the model by specifying the `final_model` parameter.

```csharp {5}
var lemurTaskParams = new LemurTaskParams
{
    Prompt = prompt,
    TranscriptIds = [transcript.Id],
    FinalModel = LemurModel.AnthropicClaude3_5_Sonnet
};
```

| Model                 | SDK Parameter                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | `LemurModel.AnthropicClaude3_5_Sonnet` | Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most intelligent model to date, outperforming Claude 3 Opus on a wide range of evaluations, with the speed and cost of Claude 3 Sonnet. This uses Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model version `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`. |
| **Claude 3.0 Opus**   | `LemurModel.AnthropicClaude3_Opus`     | Claude 3 Opus is good at handling complex analysis, longer tasks with many steps, and higher-order math and coding tasks.                                                                                                                            |
| **Claude 3.0 Haiku**  | `LemurModel.AnthropicClaude3_Haiku`    | Claude 3 Haiku is the fastest model that can execute lightweight actions.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Claude 3.0 Sonnet** | `LemurModel.AnthropicClaude3_Sonnet`   | Claude 3 Sonnet is a legacy model with a balanced combination of performance and speed for efficient, high-throughput tasks.                                                                                                                         |

You can find more information on pricing for each model <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Change the maximum output size

You can change the maximum output size in tokens by specifying the `MaxOutputSize` parameter. Up to 4000 tokens are allowed.

```csharp {5}
var lemurTaskParams = new LemurTaskParams
{
    Prompt = prompt,
    TranscriptIds = [transcript.Id],
    MaxOutputSize = 1000
};
```

## Change the temperature

You can change the temperature by specifying the `temperature` parameter, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

Higher values result in answers that are more creative, lower values are more conservative.

```csharp {5}
var lemurTaskParams = new LemurTaskParams
{
    Prompt = prompt,
    TranscriptIds = [transcript.Id],
    Temperature = 0.7f
};
```

## Send customized input

You can submit custom text inputs to LeMUR without transcript IDs. This allows you to customize the input, for example, you could include the speaker labels for the LLM.

To submit custom text input, use the `InputText` parameter instead of `TranscriptIds`.

```csharp {15}
var transcript = await client.Transcripts.TranscribeAsync(new TranscriptParams
{
    AudioUrl = "https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3",
    SpeakerLabels = true
});

var textWithSpeakerLabels = string.Join(
    "",
    transcript.Utterances!.Select(utterance => $"Speaker {utterance.Speaker}:\n{utterance.Text}\n")
);

var lemurTaskParams = new LemurTaskParams
{
    Prompt = prompt,
    InputText = textWithSpeakerLabels
};

var response = await client.Lemur.TaskAsync(lemurTaskParams);
```

## Submit multiple transcripts

LeMUR can easily ingest multiple transcripts in a single API call.

You can feed in up to a maximum of 100 hours.

```csharp {4}
var lemurTaskParams = new LemurTaskParams
{
    Prompt = prompt,
    TranscriptIds = [id1, id2, id3]
};
```

## Delete LeMUR request data

You can delete the data for a previously submitted LeMUR request.

Response data from the LLM, as well as any context provided in the original request will be removed.

```csharp {3}
var response = await client.Lemur.TaskAsync(lemurTaskParams);

var deletionResponse = await client.Lemur.PurgeRequestDataAsync(response.RequestId);
```
