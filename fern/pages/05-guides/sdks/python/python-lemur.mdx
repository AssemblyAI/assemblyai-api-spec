# LeMUR

## Summarize your audio data

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"

transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

# You can use a local filepath:
# audio_file = "./example.mp3"

# Or use a publicly-accessible URL:
audio_file = (
    "https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3"
)
transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_file)

prompt = "Provide a brief summary of the transcript."

result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt, final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)

print(result.response)
```

If you run the code above, you'll see the following output:

```plain
The transcript describes several common sports injuries - runner's knee,
sprained ankle, meniscus tear, rotator cuff tear, and ACL tear. It provides
definitions, causes, and symptoms for each injury. The transcript seems to be
narrating sports footage and describing injuries as they occur to the athletes.
Overall, it provides an overview of these common sports injuries that can result
from overuse or sudden trauma during athletic activities
```

## Ask questions about your audio data

**Q&A with the task endpoint**

To ask question about your audio data, define a prompt with your questions and call `transcript.lemur.task()`. The underlying `transcript` is automatically used as additional context for the model.

```python {12-13,15-18}
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"

# Step 1: Transcribe an audio file.
# audio_file = "./local_file.mp3"
audio_file = "https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3"

transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_file)

# Step 2: Define a prompt with your question(s).
prompt = "What is a runner's knee?"

# Step 3: Apply LeMUR.
result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt, final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)

print(result.response)
```

#**Example output**

```plain
Based on the transcript, runner's knee is a condition characterized
by pain behind or around the kneecap. It is caused by overuse,
muscle imbalance and inadequate stretching. Symptoms include pain
under or around the kneecap and pain when walking.
```

**Q&A with the question-answer endpoint**

The [LeMUR Question & Answer function](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur/question-answer) requires no prompt engineering and facilitates more deterministic and structured outputs. See the code examples below for more information on how to use this endpoint.

To use it, define a list of `aai.LemurQuestion` objects. For each question, you can define additional `context` and specify either a `answer_format` or a list of `answer_options`. Additionally, you can define an overall `context`.

```python {8-16,18-22}
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"

audio_url = "https://assembly.ai/meeting.mp4"
transcript = aai.Transcriber().transcribe(audio_url)

questions = [
    aai.LemurQuestion(
        question="What are the top level KPIs for engineering?",
        context="KPI stands for key performance indicator",
        answer_format="short sentence"),
    aai.LemurQuestion(
        question="How many days has it been since the data team has gotten updated metrics?",
        answer_options=["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "more than 7"]),
]

result = transcript.lemur.question(
    final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet,
    questions,
    context="A GitLab meeting to discuss logistics"
)

for qa_response in result.response:
    print(f"Question: {qa_response.question}")
    print(f"Answer: {qa_response.answer}")
```

For the full API reference, as well as the supported models and FAQs, refer to the [full LeMUR Q&A guide](/docs/lemur/ask-questions).

## Change the model type

LeMUR features the following LLMs:

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Claude 3 Opus
- Claude 3 Haiku
- Claude 3 Sonnet

You can switch the model by specifying the `final_model` parameter.

```python {3}
result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt,
    final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)
```

| Model                 | SDK Parameter                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | `aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet` | Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most intelligent model to date, outperforming Claude 3 Opus on a wide range of evaluations, with the speed and cost of Claude 3 Sonnet. This uses Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model version `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`. |
| **Claude 3.0 Opus**   | `aai.LemurModel.claude3_opus`     | Claude 3 Opus is good at handling complex analysis, longer tasks with many steps, and higher-order math and coding tasks.                                                                                                                            |
| **Claude 3.0 Haiku**  | `aai.LemurModel.claude3_haiku`    | Claude 3 Haiku is the fastest model that can execute lightweight actions.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Claude 3.0 Sonnet** | `aai.LemurModel.claude3_sonnet`   | Claude 3 Sonnet is a legacy model with a balanced combination of performance and speed for efficient, high-throughput tasks.                                                                                                                         |

You can find more information on pricing for each model <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Change the maximum output size

You can control the maximum output size by setting the max_output_size parameter. [See the limits for each model here.](/docs/lemur/customize-parameters#change-the-maximum-output-size)

```python {3}
result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt,
    max_output_size=1000
)
```

## Change the temperature

You can change the temperature by specifying the `temperature` parameter, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

Higher values result in answers that are more creative, lower values are more conservative.

```python {3}
result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt,
    temperature=0.7
)
```

## Send customized input

You can submit custom text inputs to LeMUR without transcript IDs. This allows you to customize the input, for example, you could include the speaker labels for the LLM.

To submit custom text input, use the `input_text` parameter on `aai.Lemur().task()`.

```python {12}
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(
  speaker_labels=True,
)
transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_url, config=config)

text_with_speaker_labels = ""
for utt in transcript.utterances:
    text_with_speaker_labels += f"Speaker {utt.speaker}:\n{utt.text}\n"

result = aai.Lemur().task(
    prompt,
    input_text=text_with_speaker_labels
)
```

## Submit multiple transcripts

LeMUR can easily ingest multiple transcripts in a single API call.

You can feed in up to a maximum of 100 hours.

```python {1-7}
transcript_group = transcriber.transcribe_group(
    [
        "https://example.org/customer1.mp3",
        "https://example.org/customer2.mp3",
        "https://example.org/customer3.mp3",
    ],
)

# Or use existing transcripts:
# transcript_group = aai.TranscriptGroup.get_by_ids([id1, id2, id3])

result = transcript_group.lemur.task(
  prompt="Provide a summary of these customer calls."
)
```

## Delete LeMUR request data

You can delete the data for a previously submitted LeMUR request.

Response data from the LLM, as well as any context provided in the original request will be removed.

```python {3}
result = transcript.lemur.task(prompt)

deletion_response = aai.Lemur.purge_request_data(result.request_id)
```
