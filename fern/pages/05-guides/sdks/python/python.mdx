pip install -U assemblyai

## How the SDK handles Default Configurations

### Defining Defaults

When no `TranscriptionConfig` is being passed to the `Transcriber` or its methods, it will use a default instance of a `TranscriptionConfig`.

If you would like to re-use the same `TranscriptionConfig` for all your transcriptions,
you can set it on the `Transcriber` directly:

```python
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(punctuate=False, format_text=False)

transcriber = aai.Transcriber(config=config)

# will use the same config for all `.transcribe*(...)` operations
transcriber.transcribe("https://example.org/audio.wav")
```

### Overriding Defaults

You can override the default configuration later via the `.config` property of the `Transcriber`:

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

# override the `Transcriber`'s config with a new config
transcriber.config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(punctuate=False, format_text=False)
```

In case you want to override the `Transcriber`'s configuration for a specific operation with a different one, you can do so via the `config` parameter of a `.transcribe*(...)` method:

```python
config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(punctuate=False, format_text=False)
# set a default configuration
transcriber = aai.Transcriber(config=config)

transcriber.transcribe(
    "https://example.com/audio.mp3",
    # overrides the above configuration on the `Transcriber` with the following
    config=aai.TranscriptionConfig(dual_channel=True, disfluencies=True)
)
```

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous

Currently, the SDK provides two ways to transcribe audio files.

The synchronous approach halts the application's flow until the transcription has been completed.

The asynchronous approach allows the application to continue running while the transcription is being processed. The caller receives a [`concurrent.futures.Future`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) object which can be used to check the status of the transcription at a later time.

You can identify those two approaches by the `_async` suffix in the `Transcriber`'s method name (e.g. `transcribe` vs `transcribe_async`).

## Getting the HTTP status code

There are two ways of accessing the HTTP status code:

- All custom AssemblyAI Error classes have a `status_code` attribute.
- The latest HTTP response is stored in `aai.Client.get_default().latest_response` after every API call. This approach works also if no Exception is thrown.

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

# Option 1: Catch the error
try:
    transcript = transcriber.submit("./example.mp3")
except aai.AssemblyAIError as e:
    print(e.status_code)

# Option 2: Access the latest response through the client
client = aai.Client.get_default()

try:
    transcript = transcriber.submit("./example.mp3")
except:
    print(client.last_response)
    print(client.last_response.status_code)
```

## Polling Intervals

By default we poll the `Transcript`'s status each `3s`. In case you would like to adjust that interval:

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.polling_interval = 1.0
```

## Retrieving Existing Transcripts

### Retrieving a Single Transcript

If you previously created a transcript, you can use its ID to retrieve it later.

```python
import assemblyai as aai

transcript = aai.Transcript.get_by_id("<TRANSCRIPT_ID>")

print(transcript.id)
print(transcript.text)
```

### Retrieving Multiple Transcripts as a Group

You can also retrieve multiple existing transcripts and combine them into a single `TranscriptGroup` object. This allows you to perform operations on the transcript group as a single unit, such as querying the combined transcripts with LeMUR.

```python
import assemblyai as aai

transcript_group = aai.TranscriptGroup.get_by_ids(["<TRANSCRIPT_ID_1>", "<TRANSCRIPT_ID_2>"])

summary = transcript_group.lemur.summarize(context="Customers asking for cars", answer_format="TLDR")

print(summary)
```

### Retrieving Transcripts Asynchronously

Both `Transcript.get_by_id` and `TranscriptGroup.get_by_ids` have asynchronous counterparts, `Transcript.get_by_id_async` and `TranscriptGroup.get_by_ids_async`, respectively. These functions immediately return a `Future` object, rather than blocking until the transcript(s) are retrieved.
