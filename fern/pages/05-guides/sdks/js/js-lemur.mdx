# LeMUR

## Summarize your audio data

```ts
import { AssemblyAI } from "assemblyai";

const client = new AssemblyAI({
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
});

// You can use a local filepath:
// const audioFile = "./example.mp3"

// Or use a publicly-accessible URL:
const audioFile = "https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3";

const run = async () => {
  const transcript = await client.transcripts.transcribe({ audio: audioFile });

  const prompt = "Provide a brief summary of the transcript.";

  const { response } = await client.lemur.task({
    transcript_ids: [transcript.id],
    prompt,
    final_model: "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet",
  });

  console.log(response);
};

run();
```

If you run the code above, you'll see the following output:

```plain
The transcript describes several common sports injuries - runner's knee,
sprained ankle, meniscus tear, rotator cuff tear, and ACL tear. It provides
definitions, causes, and symptoms for each injury. The transcript seems to be
narrating sports footage and describing injuries as they occur to the athletes.
Overall, it provides an overview of these common sports injuries that can result
from overuse or sudden trauma during athletic activities
```

## Ask questions about your audio data

**Q&A with the task endpoint**

To ask question about your audio data, define a prompt with your questions and call `client.lemur.task()`. Use the `transcript_ids` parameter to send one or more transcripts as additional context for the model.

```ts {14-15,17-22}
import { AssemblyAI } from "assemblyai";

const client = new AssemblyAI({
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
});

const run = async () => {
  // Step 1: Transcribe an audio file.
  //const audioFile = './local_file.mp3'
  const audioFile = "https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3";
  const transcript = await client.transcripts.transcribe({ audio: audioFile });

  // Step 2: Define a prompt with your question(s).
  const prompt = "What is a runner's knee?";

  // Step 3: Apply LeMUR.
  const { response } = await client.lemur.task({
    transcript_ids: [transcript.id],
    prompt,
    final_model: "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet",
  });

  console.log(response);
};

run();
```

#**Example output**

```plain
Based on the transcript, runner's knee is a condition characterized
by pain behind or around the kneecap. It is caused by overuse,
muscle imbalance and inadequate stretching. Symptoms include pain
under or around the kneecap and pain when walking.
```

**Q&A with the question-answer endpoint**

The [LeMUR Question & Answer function](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur/question-answer) requires no prompt engineering and facilitates more deterministic and structured outputs. See the code examples below for more information on how to use this endpoint.

To use it, define a list of `questions`. For each question, you can define additional `context` and specify either a `answer_format` or a list of `answer_options`. Additionally, you can define an overall `context`.

```ts {12-23,25-30}
import { AssemblyAI } from "assemblyai";

const client = new AssemblyAI({
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
});

const audioUrl = "https://assembly.ai/meeting.mp4";

const run = async () => {
  const transcript = await client.transcripts.transcribe({ audio: audioUrl });

  const questions = [
    {
      question: "What are the top level KPIs for engineering?",
      context: "KPI stands for key performance indicator",
      answer_format: "short sentence",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How many days has it been since the data team has gotten updated metrics?",
      answer_options: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "more than 7"],
    },
  ];

  const { response: qas } = await client.lemur.questionAnswer({
    transcript_ids: [transcript.id],
    final_model: "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet",
    context: "A GitLab meeting to discuss logistics",
    questions: questions,
  });

  for (const { question, answer } of qas) {
    console.log("Question", question);
    console.log("Answer", answer);
  }
};

run();
```

## Change the model type

LeMUR features the following LLMs:

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Claude 3 Opus
- Claude 3 Haiku
- Claude 3 Sonnet

You can switch the model by specifying the `final_model` parameter.

```ts {4}
const { response } = await client.lemur.task({
  transcript_ids: [transcript.id],
  prompt,
  final_model: "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet",
});
```

| Model                 | SDK Parameter                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | `'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet'` | Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most intelligent model to date, outperforming Claude 3 Opus on a wide range of evaluations, with the speed and cost of Claude 3 Sonnet. This uses Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model version `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`. |
| **Claude 3.0 Opus**   | `'anthropic/claude-3-opus'`     | Claude 3 Opus is good at handling complex analysis, longer tasks with many steps, and higher-order math and coding tasks.                                                                                                                            |
| **Claude 3.0 Haiku**  | `'anthropic/claude-3-haiku'`    | Claude 3 Haiku is the fastest model that can execute lightweight actions.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Claude 3.0 Sonnet** | `'anthropic/claude-3-sonnet'`   | Claude 3 Sonnet is a legacy model with a balanced combination of performance and speed for efficient, high-throughput tasks.                                                                                                                         |

You can find more information on pricing for each model <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Change the maximum output size

You can control the maximum output size by setting the max_output_size parameter. [See the limits for each model here.](/docs/lemur/customize-parameters#change-the-maximum-output-size)

```ts {4}
const { response } = await client.lemur.task({
  transcript_ids: [transcript.id],
  prompt,
  max_output_size: 1000,
});
```

## Change the temperature

You can change the temperature by specifying the `temperature` parameter, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

Higher values result in answers that are more creative, lower values are more conservative.

```ts {4}
const { response } = await client.lemur.task({
  transcript_ids: [transcript.id],
  prompt,
  temperature: 0.7,
});
```

## Send customized input

You can submit custom text inputs to LeMUR without transcript IDs. This allows you to customize the input, for example, you could include the speaker labels for the LLM.

To submit custom text input, use the `input_text` parameter instead of `transcript_ids`.

```ts {14}
const params = {
  audio: audioUrl,
  speaker_labels: true,
};
const transcript = await client.transcripts.transcribe(params);

const textWithSpeakerLabels = "";
for (let utterance of transcript.utterances!) {
  textWithSpeakerLabels += `Speaker ${utterance.speaker}:\n${utterance.text}\n`;
}

const { response } = await client.lemur.task({
  prompt: prompt,
  input_text: textWithSpeakerLabels,
});
```

## Submit multiple transcripts

LeMUR can easily ingest multiple transcripts in a single API call.

You can feed in 100 hours of audio.

```ts {2}
const { response } = await client.lemur.task({
  transcript_ids: [id1, id2, id3],
  prompt: "Provide a summary of these customer calls.",
});
```

## Delete LeMUR request data

You can delete the data for a previously submitted LeMUR request.

Response data from the LLM, as well as any context provided in the original request will be removed.

```ts {6}
const { response, request_id } = await client.lemur.task({
  transcript_ids: [transcript.id],
  prompt,
});

const deletionResponse = await client.lemur.purgeRequestData(request_id);
```
