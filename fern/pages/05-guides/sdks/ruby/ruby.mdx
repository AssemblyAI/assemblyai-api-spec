<Warning title="Deprecation Notice">
  As of April 2025, AssemblyAI Ruby SDK has been discontinued and will no longer be maintained. While the SDK will no longer be updated, any previously published releases will remain available.

  Going forward, see the [Ruby Pre-Recorded Audio page](/docs/getting-started/transcribe-an-audio-file/ruby) for information on how to integrate with our API directly.

  We know this is a disruptive change. If you need help with this transition, reach out to our Support team at support@assemblyai.com and we'll help you in any way we can.
</Warning>

The AssemblyAI Ruby SDK provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the AssemblyAI API, which supports async,
audio intelligence models, as well as the latest LeMUR models.

The Ruby SDK does not support Streaming STT.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add assemblyai

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install assemblyai
```
