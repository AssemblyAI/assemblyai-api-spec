<Warning title="Deprecation Notice">

As of April 2025, AssemblyAI Ruby SDK has been discontinued and will no longer be maintained. While the SDK will no longer be updated, any previously published releases will remain available.

Going forward, see the [LeMUR page](/docs/lemur/apply-llms-to-audio-files) for information on how to integrate with our API directly.

We know this is a disruptive change. If you need help with this transition, reach out to our Support team at support@assemblyai.com and we'll help you in any way we can.

</Warning>

# LeMUR

## Summarize your audio data

```ruby
require 'assemblyai'

client = AssemblyAI::Client.new(api_key: '<YOUR_API_KEY>')

# You can upload and transcribe a local file:
# uploaded_file = client.files.upload(file: '/path/to/your/file')
# transcript = client.transcripts.transcribe(audio_url: uploaded_file.upload_url, speaker_labels: true)

# Or use a publicly-accessible URL:
audio_url = 'https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3'

transcript = client.transcripts.transcribe(audio_url: audio_url)

result = client.lemur.task(
  transcript_ids: [transcript.id],
  prompt: 'Provide a brief summary of the transcript.',
  final_model: AssemblyAI::Lemur::LemurModel::ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE3_5_SONNET
)

puts result.response
```

If you run the code above, you'll see the following output:

```plain
The transcript describes several common sports injuries - runner's knee,
sprained ankle, meniscus tear, rotator cuff tear, and ACL tear. It provides
definitions, causes, and symptoms for each injury. The transcript seems to be
narrating sports footage and describing injuries as they occur to the athletes.
Overall, it provides an overview of these common sports injuries that can result
from overuse or sudden trauma during athletic activities
```

## Ask questions about your audio data

**Q&A with the task endpoint**

To ask question about your audio data, define a prompt with your questions and call `client.lemur.task()`. Use the `transcript_ids` parameter to send one or more transcripts as additional context for the model.

```ruby {9-10,12-17}
require 'assemblyai'

client = AssemblyAI::Client.new(api_key: '<YOUR_API_KEY>')

# Step 1: Transcribe an audio file. For local files see our Getting Started guides.
audio_url = 'https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3'
transcript = client.transcripts.transcribe(audio_url: audio_url)

# Step 2: Define a prompt with your question(s).
prompt = "What is a runner's knee?"

# Step 3: Apply LeMUR.
response = client.lemur.task(
  prompt: prompt,
  transcript_ids: [transcript.id],
  final_model: AssemblyAI::Lemur::LemurModel::ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE3_5_SONNET
)

puts response.response
```

#**Example output**

```plain
Based on the transcript, runner's knee is a condition characterized
by pain behind or around the kneecap. It is caused by overuse,
muscle imbalance and inadequate stretching. Symptoms include pain
under or around the kneecap and pain when walking.
```

**Q&A with the question-answer endpoint**

The [LeMUR Question & Answer function](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur/question-answer) requires no prompt engineering and facilitates more deterministic and structured outputs. See the code examples below for more information on how to use this endpoint.

To use it, define a list of `questions`. For each question, you can define additional `context` and specify either a `answer_format` or a list of `answer_options`. Additionally, you can define an overall `context`.

```ruby {9-25}
require 'assemblyai'

client = AssemblyAI::Client.new(api_key: '<YOUR_API_KEY>')

audio_url = 'https://assembly.ai/meeting.mp4'

transcript = client.transcripts.transcribe(audio_url: audio_url)

response = client.lemur.question_answer(
  transcript_ids: [transcript.id],
  final_model: AssemblyAI::Lemur::LemurModel::ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE3_5_SONNET,
  context: 'A GitLab meeting to discuss logistic',
  questions: [
    {
      question: 'What are the top level KPIs for engineering?',
      context: 'KPI stands for key performance indicator',
      answer_format: 'short sentence'
    },
    {
      question: 'How many days has it been since the data team has gotten updated metrics?',
      context: 'KPI stands for key performance indicator',
      answer_options: ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', 'more than 7']
    }
  ]
)

response.response.each do |qa|
  printf("Question: %<question>s\n", question: qa.question)
  printf("Answer: %<answer>s\n", answer: qa.answer)
end
```

For the full API reference, as well as the supported models and FAQs, refer to the [full LeMUR Q&A guide](/docs/lemur/ask-questions).

## Change the model type

LeMUR features the following LLMs:

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Claude 3 Opus
- Claude 3 Haiku
- Claude 3 Sonnet

You can switch the model by specifying the `final_model` parameter.

```ruby {4}
response = client.lemur.task(
  prompt: prompt,
  transcript_ids: [transcript_id],
  final_model: AssemblyAI::Lemur::LemurModel::ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE3_5_SONNET
)
```

| Model                 | SDK Parameter                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

You can find more information on pricing for each model <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Change the maximum output size

You can control the maximum output size by setting the max_output_size parameter. [See the limits for each model here.](/docs/lemur/customize-parameters#change-the-maximum-output-size) tokens are allowed.

```ruby {4}
response = client.lemur.task(
  prompt: prompt,
  transcript_ids: [transcript_id],
  max_output_size: 1000
)
```

## Change the temperature

You can change the temperature by specifying the `temperature` parameter, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

Higher values result in answers that are more creative, lower values are more conservative.

```ruby {4}
response = client.lemur.task(
  prompt: prompt,
  transcript_ids: [transcript_id],
  temperature: 0.7
)
```

## Send customized input

You can submit custom text inputs to LeMUR without transcript IDs. This allows you to customize the input, for example, you could include the speaker labels for the LLM.

To submit custom text input, use the `input_text` parameter instead of `transcript_ids`.

```ruby {16}
transcript = client.transcripts.transcribe(
  audio_url: audio_url,
  speaker_labels: true
)

text_with_speaker_labels = (transcript.utterances.map do |utterance|
  sprintf(
    "Speaker %<speaker>s:\n%<text>s\n",
    speaker: utterance.speaker,
    text: utterance.text
  )
end).join("\n")

response = client.lemur.task(
  prompt: prompt,
  input_text: text_with_speaker_labels
)

puts response.response
```

## Submit multiple transcripts

LeMUR can easily ingest multiple transcripts in a single API call.

You can feed in up to a maximum of 100 files or 100 hours, whichever is lower.

```ruby {3}
response = client.lemur.task(
  prompt: prompt,
  transcript_ids: [id1, id2, id3]
)
```

## Delete LeMUR request data

You can delete the data for a previously submitted LeMUR request.

Response data from the LLM, as well as any context provided in the original request will be removed.

```ruby {6}
response = client.lemur.task(
  prompt: prompt,
  transcript_ids: [transcript_id],
)

deletion_response = client.lemur.purge_request_data(request_id: response.request_id)
```
