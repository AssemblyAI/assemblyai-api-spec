description: "Automatically detect the language using a cost-effective Nano ALD workflow"
---

In this guide, you'll learn how to perform automatic language detection (ALD) separately from the transcription process. For the transcription, the file then gets routed to either the [Best or Nano](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/select-the-speech-model-with-best-and-nano) model class, depending on the supported language.

This workflow is designed to be cost-effective, slicing the first 60 seconds of audio and running it through Nano ALD, which detects 99 languages, at a cost of $0.002 per transcript for this language detection workflow (not including the total transcription cost).

Performing ALD with this workflow has a few benefits:

- Cost-effective language detection
- Ability to detect 99 languages
- Ability to use Nano as fallback if the language is not supported in Best
- Ability to enable [Audio Intelligence models](/audio-intelligence) if the [language is supported](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/supported-languages)
- Ability to use [LeMUR](/lemur) with LLM prompts in Spanish for Spanish audio

## Before you begin

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
- A <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup" target="_blank">free AssemblyAI account</a>.

The entire source code of this guide can be viewed [here](https://github.com/AssemblyAI/cookbook/blob/master/core-transcription/automatic-language-detection-separate.ipynb).

## Step-by-step instructions

Install the Python SDK:

```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

Create a set with all supported languages for Best. You can find them in our [documentation here](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/supported-languages#supported-languages-for-best).

```python
supported_languages_for_best = {
    "en",
    "es",
    "fr",
    "de",
    "it",
    "pt",
    "nl",
    "hi",
    "ja",
    "zh",
    "fi",
    "ko",
    "pl",
    "ru",
    "tr",
    "uk",
    "vi",
}
```

Define a `Transcriber`. Note that here we don't pass in a global `TranscriptionConfig`, but later apply different ones during the `transcribe()` call.

```python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
```

Define two helper functions:

- `detect_language()` performs language detection on the [first 60 seconds](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/transcripts/submit#request.body.audio_end_at) of the audio using Nano and returns the language code.
- `transcribe_file()` performs the transcription using Best or Nano depending on the identified language.

```python
def detect_language(audio_url):
    config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(
        audio_end_at=60000,  # first 60 seconds (in milliseconds)
        language_detection=True,
        speech_model=aai.SpeechModel.nano,
    )
    transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_url, config=config)
    return transcript.json_response["language_code"]

def transcribe_file(audio_url, language_code):
    config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(
        language_code=language_code,
        speech_model=(
            aai.SpeechModel.best
            if language_code in supported_languages_for_best
            else aai.SpeechModel.nano
        ),
    )
    transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_url, config=config)
    return transcript
```

Test the code with different audio files. Apply both helper functions sequentially to each file to first identify the language and then transcribe the file.

```python
audio_urls = [
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/public_benchmarking_portugese.mp3",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/public_benchmarking_spanish.mp3",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/slovenian_luka_doncic_interview.mp3",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/5_common_sports_injuries.mp3",
]

for audio_url in audio_urls:
    language_code = detect_language(audio_url)
    print("Identified language:", language_code)

    transcript = transcribe_file(audio_url, language_code)
    print("Transcript:", transcript.text[:100], "...")
```

Output:

```bash
Identified language: pt
