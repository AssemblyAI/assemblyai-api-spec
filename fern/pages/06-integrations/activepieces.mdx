## AssemblyAI actions

The AssemblyAI piece for Activepieces provides the following actions:

### Files

#### Upload File

Upload an audio file to AssemblyAI so you can transcribe it.
You can pass the `Upload URL` output field to the `Audio URL` input field of [Transcribe an Audio File](#transcribe-an-audio-file) module.

### Transcripts

#### Transcribe

Transcribe an audio file and wait until the transcript has completed or failed.
Configure the `Audio URL` field with the URL of the audio file you want to transcribe.
The `Audio URL` must be accessible by AssemblyAI's servers.
If you don't have a publicly accessible URL, you can use the [Upload a File](#upload-a-file) module to upload the audio file to AssemblyAI.

If you don't want to wait until the transcript is ready, uncheck the `Wait until transcript is ready` parameter.

<Info>
  Configure your desired [Audio Intelligence models](/audio-intelligence) when
  you create the transcript. The results of the models will be included in the
  transcript output.
