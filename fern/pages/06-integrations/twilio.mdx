Twilio is a programmable communication platform for voice, messaging, and email.
By combining Twilio with AssemblyAI, you can transcribe voice calls in [real-time](../02-speech-to-text/streaming.mdx), and voice recordings and voice messages [asynchronously](../02-speech-to-text/speech-recognition.mdx).
Combine transcription with our [audio intelligence models](/audio-intelligence) and [LeMUR LLM framework](/lemur) to analyze the calls and messages.
