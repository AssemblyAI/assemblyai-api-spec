Twilio is a programmable communication platform for voice, messaging, and email.
By combining Twilio with AssemblyAI, you can transcribe voice calls in [real-time](/docs/speech-to-text/streaming), and voice recordings and voice messages [asynchronously](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio).
Combine transcription with our [audio intelligence models](/docs/audio-intelligence/summarization) and [LeMUR LLM framework](/docs/lemur/summarize-audio) to analyze the calls and messages.
