## New to LangChain?

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com) is an open-source framework for developing applications with [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/introduction-large-language-models-generative-ai/) and other AI technologies.
LangChain has a set of pre-built components that you can use to load data and apply LLMs to your data.
However, LLMs only operate on textual data and don't understand speech in audio and video files.
To apply LLMs to speech, you first need to transcribe the audio to text, which is what the AssemblyAI integration helps you with.
