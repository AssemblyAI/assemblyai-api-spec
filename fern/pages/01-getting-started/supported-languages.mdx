This page shows which languages are supported by the AssemblyAI Async API, their `language_code` values, and the features available for that language.

AssemblyAI offers two different levels of speech-to-text models for pre-recorded audio: **Universal** and **Slam-1**. Check out the [Models](/docs/getting-started/models) page of our documentation to learn more about our different models and how to choose the best one for your use case.

Below, you'll find the supported languages for each class of models, as well as instructions on how to change the language for your transcription.

## Specify the language

You can use the optional `language_code` parameter to specify the language of the spoken audio in the files that you submit to the API. If you don't include a `language_code` parameter in your request, it defaults to `en_us`.

To learn more about using the `language_code` parameter, see [Set language manually](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/set-language-manually).

<Tip>

If you're unsure of the spoken language spoken in your audio file, you can use our [Automatic Language Detection](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/automatic-language-detection) feature to automatically identify the dominant language in your file.

## Specify the speech model

You can use the optional `speech_model` parameter to specify the class of models. To learn more, see [Select the speech model](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/select-the-speech-model-with-best-and-nano).
