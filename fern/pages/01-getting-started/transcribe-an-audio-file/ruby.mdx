## Overview

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Transcribe a pre-recorded audio file.
- Enable [Speaker Diarization](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization) to detect speakers in an audio file.

Here's the full sample code for what you'll build in this tutorial:

```ruby
  require 'net/http'
  require 'json'

  base_url = 'https://api.assemblyai.com'
  headers = {
    authorization: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
    content_type: "application/json"
  }

  # Use a publicly-accessible URL:
  audio_file = "https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3"

  ''' Or upload a local file:
  path = "/my_audio.mp3"
  uri = URI("#{base_url}/v2/upload")
  request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri, headers)
  request.body = File.read(path)

  http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
  http.use_ssl = true
  upload_response = http.request(request)
  upload_url = JSON.parse(upload_response.body)["upload_url"]'''

  data = {
    audio_url: audio_file, # For local files use: audio_url: upload_url
    speaker_labels: true
  }

  uri = URI.parse("#{base_url}/v2/transcript")
  http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
  http.use_ssl = true

  request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.request_uri, headers)
  request.body = data.to_json

  response = http.request(request)
  response_body = JSON.parse(response.body)

  unless response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)
    raise "API request failed with status #{response.code}: #{response.body}"
  end

  transcript_id = response_body['id']
  puts "Transcript ID: #{transcript_id}"

  polling_endpoint = URI.parse("#{base_url}/v2/transcript/#{transcript_id}")

  while true
    polling_http = Net::HTTP.new(polling_endpoint.host, polling_endpoint.port)
    polling_http.use_ssl = true
    polling_request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(polling_endpoint.request_uri, headers)
    polling_response = polling_http.request(polling_request)

    transcription_result = JSON.parse(polling_response.body)

    if transcription_result['status'] == 'completed'
      puts "\nFull Transcript:\n\n#{transcription_result['text']}\n"

      if transcription_result['utterances']
        puts "\nSpeaker Segmentation:\n"
        transcription_result['utterances'].each do |utterance|
          puts "Speaker #{utterance['speaker']}: #{utterance['text']}"
        end
      end
      break
    elsif transcription_result['status'] == 'error'
      raise "Transcription failed: #{transcription_result['error']}"
    else
      puts "Waiting for transcription to complete..."
      sleep(3)
    end
  end
```

## Before you begin

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed.
- <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup" target="_blank">
    A free AssemblyAI account
  </a>
  .

## Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

Create a new file and import the net/http and json libraries.

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'json'
```

## Step 2: Set up the API endpoint and headers

In this step you'll set the base URL and configure your API key.

  <Steps>
    <Step>
      Browse to <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/app/api-keys" target="_blank">API Keys</a> in your dashboard, and then copy your API key.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Set the base URL and set your headers. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your copied API key.
      ```ruby
      base_url = 'https://api.assemblyai.com'
      headers = {
        authorization: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
        content_type: "application/json"
      }
      ```
    </Step>
  </Steps>

## Step 3: Submit audio for transcription

In this step, you'll submit the audio file for transcription and wait until it's completes. The time it takes to process an audio file depends on its duration and the enabled models. Most transcriptions complete within 45 seconds.

<Steps>
  <Step>

Specify a URL to the audio you want to transcribe. The URL needs to be accessible from AssemblyAI's servers. For a list of supported formats, see [FAQ](https://support.assemblyai.com/).

```ruby
audio_file = "https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3"
```

    <Note title="Local audio files">
      If you want to use a local file, you can send the file to our upload endpoint. You'll want to add some error handling in case the upload fails. If the request is successful, the upload endpoint will respond with an `upload_url` :

      ```ruby
      path = "/my_audio.mp3"
      uri = URI("#{base_url}/v2/upload")
      request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri, headers)
      request.body = File.read(path)

      http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
      http.use_ssl = true
      upload_response = http.request(request)
      upload_url = JSON.parse(upload_response.body)["upload_url"]
      ```
      We delete uploaded files from our servers either after the transcription has completed, or 24 hours after you uploaded the file. After the file has been deleted, the corresponding `upload_url` is no longer valid.
    </Note>

    <Note title="YouTube">

      YouTube URLs are not supported. If you want to transcribe a YouTube video, you need to download the audio first.

    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Pass the audio URL to the data object.

    ```ruby
    data = { audio_url: audio_file }
    # Or pass the upload_url if you used the upload endpoint
    # data = { audio_url: upload_url }
    ```

    <Tip title="Select the speech model">
      You can select the class of models to use in order to make cost-performance tradeoffs best suited for your application. See [Select the speech model](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio/select-the-speech-model-with-best-and-nano).
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Make a `POST` request to the AssemblyAI API endpoint with the payload and headers and check for potential errors.

    ```ruby
    uri = URI.parse("#{base_url}/v2/transcript")
    http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
    http.use_ssl = true

    request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.request_uri, headers)
    request.body = data.to_json

    response = http.request(request)
    response_body = JSON.parse(response.body)

    unless response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)
      raise "API request failed with status #{response.code}: #{response.body}"
    end
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    After making the request, youâ€™ll receive an `id` for the transcription. Use it to poll the API every few seconds to check the `status` of the transcript job. Once the `status` is `completed`, you can retrieve the transcript from the API response. If the `status` is `error`, print the error value to get more information on why your request failed.

    ```ruby
    transcript_id = response_body['id']
    puts "Transcript ID: #{transcript_id}"
    polling_endpoint = URI.parse("#{base_url}/v2/transcript/#{transcript_id}")

    while true
      polling_http = Net::HTTP.new(polling_endpoint.host, polling_endpoint.port)
      polling_http.use_ssl = true
      polling_request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(polling_endpoint.request_uri, headers)
      polling_response = polling_http.request(polling_request)

      transcription_result = JSON.parse(polling_response.body)

      if transcription_result['status'] == 'completed'
        puts transcription_result['text']
        break
      elsif transcription_result['status'] == 'error'
        raise "Transcription failed: #{transcription_result['error']}"
      else
        puts "Waiting for transcription to complete..."
        sleep(3)
      end
    end
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Run the application and wait for it to finish.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You've successfully transcribed your first audio file. You can see all submitted transcription jobs in the <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/app/processing-queue" target="_blank">Processing queue</a>.

## Step 4: Enable additional AI models

You can extract even more insights from the audio by enabling any of our [AI models](/audio-intelligence) using _transcription options_. In this step, you'll enable the [Speaker diarization](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization) model to detect who said what.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add the `speaker_labels` parameter to the data object.

    ```ruby
    data = {
      audio_url: audio_file, # For local files use: audio_url: upload_url
      speaker_labels: true
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Update your polling statement to iterate over the `utterances` value and print the speakers. In addition to the full transcript, you now have access to utterances from each speaker.

    ```ruby
    while true
      polling_http = Net::HTTP.new(polling_endpoint.host, polling_endpoint.port)
      polling_http.use_ssl = true
      polling_request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(polling_endpoint.request_uri, headers)
      polling_response = polling_http.request(polling_request)

      transcription_result = JSON.parse(polling_response.body)

      if transcription_result['status'] == 'completed'
        puts "\nFull Transcript:\n\n#{transcription_result['text']}\n"

        if transcription_result['utterances']
          puts "\nSpeaker Segmentation:\n"
          transcription_result['utterances'].each do |utterance|
            puts "Speaker #{utterance['speaker']}: #{utterance['text']}"
          end
        end
        break
      elsif transcription_result['status'] == 'error'
        raise "Transcription failed: #{transcription_result['error']}"
      else
        puts "Waiting for transcription to complete..."
        sleep(3)
      end
    end
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

Many of the properties in the transcript object only become available after you enable the corresponding model. For more information, see the models under [Speech-to-Text](/speech-to-text) and [Audio Intelligence](/audio-intelligence).
