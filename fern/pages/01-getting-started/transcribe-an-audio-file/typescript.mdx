## Overview

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Transcribe a pre-recorded audio file.
- Enable [Speaker Diarization](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization) to detect speakers in an audio file.

Here's the full sample code for what you'll build in this tutorial:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <Tab language="typescript-sdk" title="TypeScript SDK" default>
    ```ts
    import { AssemblyAI } from 'assemblyai'

    const client = new AssemblyAI({
      apiKey: '<YOUR_API_KEY>'
    })

    // You can use a local filepath:
    // const audioFile = "./example.mp3"

    // Or use a publicly-accessible URL:
    const audioFile = 'https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3'

    const params = {
      audio: audioFile,
      speaker_labels: true
    }

    const run = async () => {
      const transcript = await client.transcripts.transcribe(params)

      if (transcript.status === 'error') {
        console.error(`Transcription failed: ${transcript.error}`)
        process.exit(1)
      }

      console.log(transcript.text)

      for (let utterance of transcript.utterances!) {
        console.log(`Speaker ${utterance.speaker}: ${utterance.text}`)
      }
    }

    run()
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab language="typescript" title="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    import axios from 'axios'
    import fs from 'fs-extra' //For reading local files

    const baseUrl = 'https://api.assemblyai.com/v2'

    const headers = {
      authorization: '<YOUR_API_KEY>'
    }

    // Use a publicly-accessible URL:

    /* Or upload a local file:
    const audio = './my-audio.mp3'
    const audioData = await fs.readFile(path)
    const uploadResponse = await axios.post(`${baseUrl}/upload`, audioData, {
      headers
    })

    if (uploadResponse.status !== 200) {
      console.error(`Error: ${response.status}, Response: ${response.statusText}`);
      return;
    }

    const uploadUrl = uploadResponse.data.upload_url

    */

    const data = {
      audio_url: audioFile, // For local files use: audio_url: uploadUrl
      speaker_labels: true 
    }

        throw new Error(`Transcription failed: ${transcriptionResult.error}`)
      } else {
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000))
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Before you begin

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed.
- <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup" target="_blank"> A free AssemblyAI account</a>.

  <Tab language="typescript-sdk" title="TypeScript SDK" default>
    ## Step 1: Install the SDK
    Install the package via NPM:

    ```bash
    npm install assemblyai
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab language="typescript" title="TypeScript">
    ## Step 1: Install axios and fs-extra
    Install the packages via NPM:

    ```bash
    npm install axios fs-extra
    ```
    Create a new file and import axios and fs-extra.

    ```ts
    import axios from 'axios'
    import fs from 'fs-extra'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tabs groupId="language">

  <Tab language="typescript-sdk" title="TypeScript SDK" default>
    ## Step 2: Configure the SDK

    In this step, you 'll create an SDK client and configure it to use your API key.

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Browse to <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account" target="_blank">Account</a>, and then click the text under **Your API key** to copy it.
      </Step>

      <Step>
        Create a new client using your API key. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your copied API key.

        ```ts
        import { AssemblyAI } from 'assemblyai'

        const client = new AssemblyAI({
          apiKey: '<YOUR_API_KEY>'
        })
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab language="typescript" title="TypeScript">
    ## Step 2: Set up the API endpoint and headers
    In this step you'll set the base URL and configure your API key.
      <Steps>
        <Step>
          Browse to <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account" target="_blank">Account</a>, and then click the text under **Your API key** to copy it.
        </Step>

        <Step>
          Set the base URL and set your headers. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your copied API key.
          ```ts
          const baseUrl = 'https://api.assemblyai.com/v2'

          const headers = {
            authorization: '<YOUR_API_KEY>'
          }
          ```
        </Step>
      </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>



## Step 3: Submit audio for transcription

In this step, you'll submit the audio file for transcription and wait until it's completes. The time it takes to process an audio file depends on its duration and the enabled models. Most transcriptions complete within 45 seconds.

<Tabs groupId="language">

  <Tab language="typescript-sdk" title="TypeScript SDK" default>
    <Steps>
      <Step>

      Specify a URL to the audio you want to transcribe. The URL needs to be accessible from AssemblyAI's servers. For a list of supported formats, see [FAQ](https://support.assemblyai.com/).

        ```ts
        const audioFile = 'https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3'
        ```

        <Note title="Local audio files">
          If you want to use a local file, you can also specify a local path, for example:

          ```ts
          const audioFile = '/example.mp3'
          ```
        </Note>

        <Note title="YouTube">

          YouTube URLs are not supported. If you want to transcribe a YouTube video, you need to download the audio first.

        </Note>

      </Step>
      <Step>
        To generate the transcript, pass the audio URL to `client.transcripts.transcribe()`. This may take a minute while we're processing the audio.

        ```ts
        const transcript = await client.transcripts.transcribe({ audio: audioFile })
        ```

        <Tip title="Select the speech model">
        You can select the class of models to use in order to make cost-performance tradeoffs best suited for your application. See [Select the speech model](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio#select-the-speech-model-with-best-and-nano).
        </Tip>
      </Step>
      <Step>
        If the transcription failed, the `status` of the transcription will be set to
        `error`. To see why it failed you can print the value of `error`.

        ```ts
        if (transcript.status === 'error') {
          console.error(transcript.error)
          process.exit(1)
        }
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step>

        Print the complete transcript.

        ```ts
        console.log(transcript.text)
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step>
      Run the application and wait for it to finish.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab language="typescript" title="TypeScript">
      <Steps>
        <Step>

        Specify a URL to the audio you want to transcribe. The URL needs to be accessible from AssemblyAI's servers. For a list of supported formats, see [FAQ](https://support.assemblyai.com/).

        ```ts
        const audioFile = 'https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3'
        ```

          <Note title="Local audio files">
            If you want to use a local file, you can send the file to our upload endpoint. You'll want to add some error handling in case the upload fails. If the request is successful, the upload endpoint will respond with an upload URL :

            ```ts
            const audio = './my-audio.mp3'
            const audioData = await fs.readFile(path)
            const uploadResponse = await axios.post(`${baseUrl}/upload`, audioData, {
              headers
            })

            const uploadUrl = uploadResponse.data.upload_url
            ```
            We delete uploaded files from our servers either after the transcription has completed, or 24 hours after you uploaded the file. After the file has been deleted, the corresponding `upload_url` is no longer valid.
          </Note>

          <Note title="YouTube">

            YouTube URLs are not supported. If you want to transcribe a YouTube video, you need to download the audio first.

          </Note>

        </Step>
        <Step>
          Pass the audio URL to the data object.

          ```python
          data = {"audio_url": audio_file}
          # Or pass the upload_url if you used the upload endpoint
          # data = {"audio_url": upload_url}
          ```

          <Tip title="Select the speech model">
            You can select the class of models to use in order to make cost-performance tradeoffs best suited for your application. See [Select the speech model](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio#select-the-speech-model-with-best-and-nano).
          </Tip>
        </Step>
        <Step>
          Make a `POST` request to the AssemblyAI API endpoint with the payload and headers and check for potential errors.

          ```python
          response = requests.post(base_url + "/transcript", headers=headers, json=data)

          if response.status_code != 200:
              print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, Response: {response.text}")
              response.raise_for_status()
          ```
        </Step>
        <Step>

          After making the request, you’ll receive an `id` for the transcription. Use it to poll the API every few seconds to check the `status` of the transcript job. Once the `status` is `completed`, you can retrieve the transcript from the API response. If the `status` is `error`, print the error value to get more information on why your request failed. 

          ```python
          transcript_id = transcript_response["id"]
          polling_endpoint = f"{base_url}/transcript/{transcript_id}"

          while True:
              transcript = requests.get(polling_endpoint, headers=headers).json()
              if transcript["status"] == "completed":
                  print(transcript["text"])
              elif transcript["status"] == "error":
                  raise RuntimeError(f"Transcription failed: {transcript['error']}")
              else:
                  time.sleep(3)
          ```
        </Step>
        <Step>
          Run the application and wait for it to finish.
        </Step>
      </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


You've successfully transcribed your first audio file. You can see all submitted transcription jobs in the <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/app/processing-queue" target="_blank">Processing queue</a>.

## Step 4: Enable additional AI models

You can extract even more insights from the audio by enabling any of our [AI models](/audio-intelligence) using _transcription options_. In this step, you'll enable the [Speaker diarization](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization) model to detect who said what.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Set the `speaker_labels` property to `true` in the `params` object.

    ```ts
    const params = {
      audio: audioFile,
      speaker_labels: true
    }

    const transcript = await client.transcripts.transcribe(params)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In addition to the full transcript, you now have access to utterances from each speaker.

    ```typescript
    for (let utterance of transcript.utterances!) {
      console.log(`Speaker ${utterance.speaker}: ${utterance.text}`)
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Many of the properties in the transcript object only become available after you enable the corresponding model. For more information, see the models under [Speech-to-Text](/speech-to-text) and [Audio Intelligence](/audio-intelligence).
