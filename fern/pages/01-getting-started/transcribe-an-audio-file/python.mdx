## Overview

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Transcribe a pre-recorded audio file.
- Enable [Speaker Diarization](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization) to detect speakers in an audio file.

Here's the full sample code for what you'll build in this tutorial:

```python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"

transcriber = aai.Transcriber()

# You can use a local filepath:
# audio_file = "./example.mp3"

# Or use a publicly-accessible URL:
audio_file = (
    "https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3"
)

config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(speaker_labels=True)

transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_file, config)

if transcript.status == aai.TranscriptStatus.error:
    print(f"Transcription failed: {transcript.error}")
    exit(1)

print(transcript.text)

for utterance in transcript.utterances:
	print(f"Speaker {utterance.speaker}: {utterance.text}")
```

## Before you begin

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev), Java, [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download), or [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) installed.
- A <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup" target="_blank">free AssemblyAI account</a>.


## Step 1: Install the SDK
Install the package via pip:


```bash
pip install assemblyai
```

## Step 2: Configure the SDK

In this step, you 'll create an SDK client and configure it to use your API key.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Browse to <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account" target="_blank">Account</a>, and then click the text under **Your API key** to copy it.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Create a new `Transcriber` and configure it to use your API key. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your copied API key.

    ```python
    import assemblyai as aai

    aai.settings.api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"

    transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Submit audio for transcription

In this step, you'll submit the audio file for transcription and wait until it's completes. The time it takes to process an audio file depends on its duration and the enabled models. Most transcriptions complete within 45 seconds.

<Steps>
  <Step>

  Specify a URL to the audio you want to transcribe. The URL needs to be accessible from AssemblyAI's servers. For a list of supported formats, see [FAQ](https://support.assemblyai.com/).

  ```python
  audio_file = "https://assembly.ai/sports_injuries.mp3"
  ```

    <Note title="Local audio files">
      If you want to use a local file, you can also specify a local path, for example:

      ```python
      audio_file = "./example.mp3"
      ```
    </Note>

    <Note title="YouTube">

      YouTube URLs are not supported. If you want to transcribe a YouTube video, you need to download the audio first.

    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    To generate the transcript, pass the audio URL to `client.Transcripts.Transcribe()`. This may take a minute while we're processing the audio.


    ```python
    transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_file)
    ```

    <Tip title="Select the speech model">
    You can select the class of models to use in order to make cost-performance tradeoffs best suited for your application. See [Select the speech model](/docs/speech-to-text/pre-recorded-audio#select-the-speech-model-with-best-and-nano).
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    If the transcription failed, the `status` of the transcription will be set to
    `error`. To see why it failed you can print the value of `error`.

    ```python
    if transcript.error:
      print(transcript.error)
      exit(1)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>

    Print the complete transcript.

    ```python
    print(transcript.text)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Run the application and wait for it to finish.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You've successfully transcribed your first audio file. You can see all submitted transcription jobs in the <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/app/processing-queue" target="_blank">Processing queue</a>.

## Step 4: Enable additional AI models

You can extract even more insights from the audio by enabling any of our [AI models](/audio-intelligence) using _transcription options_. In this step, you'll enable the [Speaker diarization](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization) model to detect who said what.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a `TranscriptionConfig` with `speaker_labels` set to `True`, and then pass it as the second argument to `transcribe()`.

    ```python
    config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(speaker_labels=True)

    transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_file, config)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In addition to the full transcript, you now have access to utterances from each speaker.

    ```python
    for utterance in transcript.utterances:
      print(f"Speaker {utterance.speaker}: {utterance.text}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Many of the properties in the transcript object only become available after you enable the corresponding model. For more information, see the models under [Speech-to-Text](/speech-to-text) and [Audio Intelligence](/audio-intelligence).
