## Overview

Speaker Identification allows you to identify speakers by their actual names or roles, transforming generic labels like "Speaker A" or "Speaker B" into meaningful identifiers that you provide.

### What you'll get

Speaker Identification transforms your transcripts from generic labels to meaningful identifiers:

| Without Speaker Identification | With Speaker Identification |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Speaker A, Speaker B, Speaker C | Michel Martin, Peter DeCarlo, John Smith |
| Generic labels throughout entire transcript | Actual names or roles for each speaker |
| Requires manual post-processing | Automatic identification |
| Difficult to follow multi-speaker conversations | Clear attribution for each utterance |

**Example transformation:**

**Before:**
```txt
Speaker A: Good morning, and welcome to the show.
Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
Speaker A: Let's dive into today's topic...
```

**After:**
```txt
Michel Martin: Good morning, and welcome to the show.
Peter DeCarlo: Thanks for having me.
Michel Martin: Let's dive into today's topic...
```

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  Speaker Identification requires that a file be transcribed with Speaker Diarization enabled. See [this section](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization) of our documentation if you would like to learn more about the Speaker Diarization feature.

  To reliably identify speakers, your audio should contain clear, distinguishable voices and sufficient spoken audio from each speaker. The accuracy of Speaker Diarization depends on the quality of the audio and the distinctiveness of each speaker's voice, which will have a downstream effect on the quality of Speaker Identification.
</Note>

**Requirements checklist:**
- Audio file with multiple speakers
- Speaker Diarization enabled (`speaker_labels: true`)
- Clear, distinguishable voices in the audio
- Sufficient spoken audio from each speaker (recommended: at least 30 seconds per speaker)

## When to use Speaker Identification

Speaker Identification is ideal for scenarios where knowing who said what is important:

**By name:**
- **Podcast transcription**: Automatically label hosts and guests by their actual names
- **Meeting transcription**: Identify participants by name for accurate meeting minutes
- **Interview recordings**: Distinguish between interviewer and specific interviewees
- **Panel discussions**: Track contributions from individual panelists

**By role:**
- **Customer service calls**: Distinguish between Agent and Customer
- **AI interactions**: Separate AI Assistant responses from User queries
- **Technical support**: Identify Support staff versus Customer
- **Research interviews**: Label Researcher and Participant

## How to use Speaker Identification

There are two ways to use Speaker Identification:

1. **Transcribe and identify in one request** - Best when you're starting a new transcription and want speaker identification included automatically
2. **Transcribe and identify in separate requests** - Best when you already have a completed transcript or for more complex workflows where you might want to perform other tasks between the transcription and speaker identification process

### Method 1: Transcribe and identify in one request

This method is ideal when you're starting fresh and want both transcription and speaker identification in a single workflow.

```python
import requests
import time

base_url = "https://api.assemblyai.com"

headers = {
  "authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}

# Upload your audio file (optional - skip if using a public URL)
# with open("./my-audio.mp3", "rb") as f:
#   response = requests.post(base_url + "/v2/upload", headers=headers, data=f)
#   audio_url = response.json()["upload_url"]

# Or use a publicly-accessible URL
upload_url = "https://assembly.ai/wildfires.mp3"

# Configure transcript with speaker identification
data = {
  "audio_url": upload_url,
  "speaker_labels": True,
  "speech_understanding": {
    "request": {
      "speaker_identification": {
        "speaker_type": "name",
        "known_values": ["Michel Martin", "Peter DeCarlo"]  # Change these values to match the names of the speakers in your file
      }

# Submit the transcription request
response = requests.post(base_url + "/v2/transcript", headers=headers, json=data)
transcript_id = response.json()["id"]
polling_endpoint = base_url + f"/v2/transcript/{transcript_id}"

# Poll for transcription results
while True:
  transcript = requests.get(polling_endpoint, headers=headers).json()

  if transcript["status"] == "completed":
    break

  elif transcript["status"] == "error":
    raise RuntimeError(f"Transcription failed: {transcript['error']}")

  else:
    time.sleep(3)

# Access the results and print utterances to the terminal
for utterance in transcript["utterances"]:
  print(f"{utterance['speaker']}: {utterance['text']}")
```

</Tab>

### Method 2: Transcribe and identify in separate requests

This method is useful for more complex workflows where you need to separate transcription from speaker identification.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<Tab language="python" title="Python" default>

```python
import requests
import time

base_url = "https://api.assemblyai.com"

headers = {
  "authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}

# Use a publicly-accessible URL
upload_url = "https://assembly.ai/wildfires.mp3"

data = {
  "audio_url": upload_url,
  "speaker_labels": True
}

# Transcribe file
response = requests.post(base_url + "/v2/transcript", headers=headers, json=data)

transcript_id = response.json()["id"]
polling_endpoint = base_url + f"/v2/transcript/{transcript_id}"

# Poll for transcription results
while True:
  transcript = requests.get(polling_endpoint, headers=headers).json()

  if transcript["status"] == "completed":
    break

  elif transcript["status"] == "error":
    raise RuntimeError(f"Transcription failed: {transcript['error']}")

  else:
    time.sleep(3)

# Enable speaker identification
transcript["speech_understanding"] = {
  "request": {
    "speaker_identification": {
      "speaker_type": "name",
      "known_values": ["Michel Martin", "Peter DeCarlo"]  # Change these values to match the names of the speakers in your file
    }
  }
}

# Send the modified transcript to the Speech Understanding API
result = requests.post(
  "https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1/understanding",
  headers = headers,
  json = transcript
).json()

# Access the results and print utterances to the terminal
for utterance in result["utterances"]:
  print(f"{utterance['speaker']}: {utterance['text']}")
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced usage

### Identifying speakers by role

Instead of identifying speakers by name as shown in the examples above, you can also identify speakers by role.

This can be useful in customer service calls, AI interactions, or any scenario where you may not know the specific names of the speakers but still want to identify them by something more than a generic identifier like A, B, or C.

To identify speakers by role, use the `speaker_type` parameter with a value of "role":

#### Example

```python
# For Method 1 (transcribe and identify in one request):
data = {
  "audio_url": upload_url,
  "speaker_labels": True,
  "speech_understanding": {
    "request": {
      "speaker_identification": {
        "speaker_type": "role",
        "known_values": ["Interviewer", "Interviewee"]  # Roles instead of names
      }
    }
  }
}

# For Method 2 (add identification to existing transcript):
transcript["speech_understanding"] = {
  "request": {
    "speaker_identification": {
      "speaker_type": "role",
      "known_values": ["Interviewer", "Interviewee"]  # Roles instead of names
    }
  }
}

# Send the modified transcript to the Speech Understanding API
result = requests.post(
  "https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1/understanding",
  headers = headers,
  json = transcript
).json()
```

#### Common role combinations

- `["Agent", "Customer"]` - Customer service calls
- `["AI Assistant", "User"]` - AI chatbot interactions
- `["Support", "Customer"]` - Technical support calls
- `["Interviewer", "Interviewee"]` - Interview recordings
- `["Host", "Guest"]` - Podcast or show recordings
- `["Moderator", "Panelist"]` - Panel discussions

### Output format details

The Speech Understanding API transforms generic speaker labels into specific names or roles. Here is how the structure of the utterances in the `utterances` key differs when Speaker Diarization is used versus when Speaker Identification is used:

**Before (Speaker Diarization only):**
```txt wordWrap
Speaker A: ... We wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we called Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Good morning, Professor.
Speaker B: Good morning.
Speaker A: So what is it about the conditions right now that have caused this round of wildfires to affect so many people so far away?
Speaker B: Well, there's a couple of things. The season has been pretty dry already, and then the fact that we're getting hit in the US is because there's a couple weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires through Pennsylvania into the mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of just dropping the smoke there.
```

**After (with Speaker Identification):**
```txt wordWrap
Michel Martin: ... We wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we called Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Good morning, Professor.
Peter DeCarlo: Good morning.
Michel Martin: So what is it about the conditions right now that have caused this round of wildfires to affect so many people so far away?
Peter DeCarlo: Well, there's a couple of things. The season has been pretty dry already, and then the fact that we're getting hit in the US is because there's a couple weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires through Pennsylvania into the mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of just dropping the smoke there.
```

## API reference

### Request

#### Method 1: Transcribe and identify in one request

When creating a new transcription, include the `speech_understanding` parameter directly in your transcription request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "audio_url": "https://assembly.ai/wildfires.mp3",
    "speaker_labels": true,
    "speech_understanding": {
      "request": {
        "speaker_identification": {
          "speaker_type": "name",
          "known_values": ["Michel Martin", "Peter DeCarlo"]
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

#### Method 2: Add identification to existing transcripts

For existing transcripts, retrieve the completed transcript and send it to the Speech Understanding API:

```bash {6} maxLines=15
# Step 1: Get the completed transcript
transcript=$(curl -s -X GET \
  "https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript/YOUR_TRANSCRIPT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY")

# Step 2: Add speaker identification and send to Speech Understanding API
curl -X POST \
  "https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1/understanding" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(echo "$transcript" | jq '. + {
    "speech_understanding": {
      "request": {
        "speaker_identification": {
          "speaker_type": "name",
          "known_values": ["Name1", "Name2"]
        }
      }
    }
  }')"
```
