Our Translation model lets you convert transcript text or spoken audio in one language to another language or languages of your choosing.

## Quickstart

There are two ways to use Translation:

1. **Transcribe and translate in one request** - Best when you're starting a new transcription and want to automatically translate the transcript text as part of that process
2. **Transcribe and translate in separate requests** - Best when you already have text that you would like to translate or for more complicated workflows where you want to separate the transcription and translation tasks

### Method 1: Transcribe and translate in one request

This method is ideal when you're starting fresh and want both transcription and translation in a single workflow.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<Tab language="python" title="Python" default>

```python
import requests
import time

base_url = "https://api.assemblyai.com"

headers = {
  "authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}

## Use this section and comment out lines 17 and 18 to transcribe a local file
# with open("./my-audio.mp3", "rb") as f:
# response = requests.post(base_url + "/v2/upload",
# headers=headers,
# data=f)
# upload_url = response.json()["upload_url"]

# Or use a publicly-accessible URL:
upload_url = "https://assembly.ai/wildfires.mp3"

data = {
  "audio_url": upload_url,
  "speech_understanding": {
    "request": {
      "translation": {
        "target_languages": ["es"],
        "formal": True
      }
    }
  }
}

# transcribe file
response = requests.post(base_url + "/v2/transcript", headers=headers, json=data)

transcript_id = response.json()["id"]
polling_endpoint = base_url + f"/v2/transcript/{transcript_id}"

# poll for transcription results
while True:
  transcript = requests.get(polling_endpoint, headers=headers).json()

  if transcript["status"] == "completed":
    break

  elif transcript["status"] == "error":
    raise RuntimeError(f"Transcription failed: {transcript['error']}")

  else:
    time.sleep(3)

# Access the results and print the translated text(s) to the terminal
for language_code, text in transcript['translated_texts'].items():
  print(f'"{language_code}": "{text}"')
```

  "request": {
    "translation": {
        "target_languages": ["es"],
