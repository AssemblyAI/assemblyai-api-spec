## LiveKit ü§ù AssemblyAI
We've released the AssemblyAI integration for the LiveKit Agents framework, allowing developers to use our Streaming Speech-to-Text model in their real-time LiveKit applications.

LiveKit is a powerful platform for building real-time audio and video applications. It abstracts away the complicated details of building real-time applications so developers can rapidly build and deploy applications for video conferencing, livestreaming, and more.

Check out our tutorial on How to build a LiveKit app with real-time Speech-to-Text to see how you can build a real-time transcription chat feature using the integration. You can browse all of our integrations on the Integrations page of our Docs.
