                Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is triggering air
                quality alerts throughout the US. Skylines from Maine to
                Maryland to Minnesota are gray and smoggy. And in some places,
                the air quality warnings include the warning to stay inside. We
                wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we
                called Peter de Carlo, an associate professor in the Department
                of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins
                University Varsity. Good morning, professor. Good morning. What
                is it about the conditions right now that have caused this round
                of wildfires to affect so many people so far away? Well, there's
                a couple of things. The season has been pretty dry already. And
                then the fact that we're getting hit in the US. Is because
                there's a couple of weather systems that are essentially
                channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires through
                Pennsylvania into the Mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of
                just dropping the smoke there. So what is it in this haze that
                makes it harmful? And I'm assuming it is harmful. It is. The
                levels outside right now in Baltimore are considered unhealthy.
                And most of that is due to what's called particulate matter,
                which are tiny particles, microscopic smaller than the width of
                your hair that can get into your lungs and impact your
                respiratory system, your cardiovascular system, and even your
                neurological your brain. What makes this particularly harmful?
                Is it the volume of particulant? Is it something in particular?
                What is it exactly? Can you just drill down on that a little bit
                more? Yeah. So the concentration of particulate matter I was
                looking at some of the monitors that we have was reaching levels
                of what are, in science, big 150 micrograms per meter cubed,
                which is more than ten times what the annual average should be
                and about four times higher than what you're supposed to have on
                a 24 hours average. And so the concentrations of these particles
                in the air are just much, much higher than we typically see. And
                exposure to those high levels can lead to a host of health
                problems. And who is most vulnerable? I noticed that in New York
                City, for example, they're canceling outdoor activities. And so
                here it is in the early days of summer, and they have to keep
                all the kids inside. So who tends to be vulnerable in a
                situation like this? It's the youngest. So children, obviously,
                whose bodies are still developing. The elderly, who are their
                bodies are more in decline and they're more susceptible to the
                health impacts of breathing, the poor air quality. And then
                people who have preexisting health conditions, people with
                respiratory conditions or heart conditions can be triggered by
                high levels of air pollution. Could this get worse? That's a
                good question. In some areas, it's much worse than others. And
                it just depends on kind of where the smoke is concentrated. I
                think New York has some of the higher concentrations right now,
                but that's going to change as that air moves away from the New
                York area. But over the course of the next few days, we will see
                different areas being hit at different times with the highest
                concentrations. I was going to ask you about more fires start
                burning. I don't expect the concentrations to go up too much
                higher. I was going to ask you how and you started to answer
                this, but how much longer could this last? Or forgive me if I'm
                asking you to speculate, but what do you think? Well, I think
                the fires are going to burn for a little bit longer, but the key
                for us in the US. Is the weather system changing. And so right
                now, it's kind of the weather systems that are pulling that air
                into our mid Atlantic and Northeast region. As those weather
                systems change and shift, we'll see that smoke going elsewhere
                and not impact us in this region as much. And so I think that's
                going to be the defining factor. And I think the next couple of
                days we're going to see a shift in that weather pattern and
                start to push the smoke away from where we are. And finally,
                with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more
                wildfires. Will we be seeing more of these kinds of wide ranging
                air quality consequences or circumstances? I mean, that is one
                of the predictions for climate change. Looking into the future,
                the fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer, and
                we're seeing more frequent fires. So, yeah, this is probably
                something that we'll be seeing more frequently. This tends to be
                much more of an issue in the Western US. So the eastern US.
                Getting hit right now is a little bit new. But yeah, I think
                with climate change moving forward, this is something that is
                going to happen more frequently. That's Peter De Carlo,
                associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health
                and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Sergeant Carlo,
                thanks so much for joining us and sharing this expertise with
                us. Thank you for having me.

                Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is triggering air
                quality alerts throughout the US. Skylines from Maine to
                Maryland to Minnesota are gray and smoggy. And in some places,
                the air quality warnings include the warning to stay inside. We
                wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we
                called Peter de Carlo, an associate professor in the Department
                of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins
                University Varsity. Good morning, professor. Good morning. What
                is it about the conditions right now that have caused this round
                of wildfires to affect so many people so far away? Well, there's
                a couple of things. The season has been pretty dry already. And
                then the fact that we're getting hit in the US. Is because
                there's a couple of weather systems that are essentially
                channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires through
                Pennsylvania into the Mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of
                just dropping the smoke there. So what is it in this haze that
                makes it harmful? And I'm assuming it is harmful. It is. The
                levels outside right now in Baltimore are considered unhealthy.
                And most of that is due to what's called particulate matter,
                which are tiny particles, microscopic smaller than the width of
                your hair that can get into your lungs and impact your
                respiratory system, your cardiovascular system, and even your
                neurological your brain. What makes this particularly harmful?
                Is it the volume of particulant? Is it something in particular?
                What is it exactly? Can you just drill down on that a little bit
                more? Yeah. So the concentration of particulate matter I was
                looking at some of the monitors that we have was reaching levels
                of what are, in science, big 150 micrograms per meter cubed,
                which is more than ten times what the annual average should be
                and about four times higher than what you're supposed to have on
                a 24 hours average. And so the concentrations of these particles
                in the air are just much, much higher than we typically see. And
                exposure to those high levels can lead to a host of health
                problems. And who is most vulnerable? I noticed that in New York
                City, for example, they're canceling outdoor activities. And so
                here it is in the early days of summer, and they have to keep
                all the kids inside. So who tends to be vulnerable in a
                situation like this? It's the youngest. So children, obviously,
                whose bodies are still developing. The elderly, who are their
                bodies are more in decline and they're more susceptible to the
                health impacts of breathing, the poor air quality. And then
                people who have preexisting health conditions, people with
                respiratory conditions or heart conditions can be triggered by
                high levels of air pollution. Could this get worse? That's a
                good question. In some areas, it's much worse than others. And
                it just depends on kind of where the smoke is concentrated. I
                think New York has some of the higher concentrations right now,
                but that's going to change as that air moves away from the New
                York area. But over the course of the next few days, we will see
                different areas being hit at different times with the highest
                concentrations. I was going to ask you about more fires start
                burning. I don't expect the concentrations to go up too much
                higher. I was going to ask you how and you started to answer
                this, but how much longer could this last? Or forgive me if I'm
                asking you to speculate, but what do you think? Well, I think
                the fires are going to burn for a little bit longer, but the key
                for us in the US. Is the weather system changing. And so right
                now, it's kind of the weather systems that are pulling that air
                into our mid Atlantic and Northeast region. As those weather
                systems change and shift, we'll see that smoke going elsewhere
                and not impact us in this region as much. And so I think that's
                going to be the defining factor. And I think the next couple of
                days we're going to see a shift in that weather pattern and
                start to push the smoke away from where we are. And finally,
                with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more
                wildfires. Will we be seeing more of these kinds of wide ranging
                air quality consequences or circumstances? I mean, that is one
                of the predictions for climate change. Looking into the future,
                the fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer, and
                we're seeing more frequent fires. So, yeah, this is probably
                something that we'll be seeing more frequently. This tends to be
                much more of an issue in the Western US. So the eastern US.
                Getting hit right now is a little bit new. But yeah, I think
                with climate change moving forward, this is something that is
                going to happen more frequently. That's Peter De Carlo,
                associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health
                and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Sergeant Carlo,
                thanks so much for joining us and sharing this expertise with
                us. Thank you for having me.

                Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is triggering air
                quality alerts throughout the US. Skylines from Maine to
                Maryland to Minnesota are gray and smoggy. And in some places,
                the air quality warnings include the warning to stay inside. We
                wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we
                called Peter de Carlo, an associate professor in the Department
                of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins
                University Varsity. Good morning, professor. Good morning. What
                is it about the conditions right now that have caused this round
                of wildfires to affect so many people so far away? Well, there's
                a couple of things. The season has been pretty dry already. And
                then the fact that we're getting hit in the US. Is because
                there's a couple of weather systems that are essentially
                channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires through
                Pennsylvania into the Mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of
                just dropping the smoke there. So what is it in this haze that
                makes it harmful? And I'm assuming it is harmful. It is. The
                levels outside right now in Baltimore are considered unhealthy.
                And most of that is due to what's called particulate matter,
                which are tiny particles, microscopic smaller than the width of
                your hair that can get into your lungs and impact your
                respiratory system, your cardiovascular system, and even your
                neurological your brain. What makes this particularly harmful?
                Is it the volume of particulant? Is it something in particular?
                What is it exactly? Can you just drill down on that a little bit
                more? Yeah. So the concentration of particulate matter I was
                looking at some of the monitors that we have was reaching levels
                of what are, in science, big 150 micrograms per meter cubed,
                which is more than ten times what the annual average should be
                and about four times higher than what you're supposed to have on
                a 24 hours average. And so the concentrations of these particles
                in the air are just much, much higher than we typically see. And
                exposure to those high levels can lead to a host of health
                problems. And who is most vulnerable? I noticed that in New York
                City, for example, they're canceling outdoor activities. And so
                here it is in the early days of summer, and they have to keep
                all the kids inside. So who tends to be vulnerable in a
                situation like this? It's the youngest. So children, obviously,
                whose bodies are still developing. The elderly, who are their
                bodies are more in decline and they're more susceptible to the
                health impacts of breathing, the poor air quality. And then
                people who have preexisting health conditions, people with
                respiratory conditions or heart conditions can be triggered by
                high levels of air pollution. Could this get worse? That's a
                good question. In some areas, it's much worse than others. And
                it just depends on kind of where the smoke is concentrated. I
                think New York has some of the higher concentrations right now,
                but that's going to change as that air moves away from the New
                York area. But over the course of the next few days, we will see
                different areas being hit at different times with the highest
                concentrations. I was going to ask you about more fires start
                burning. I don't expect the concentrations to go up too much
                higher. I was going to ask you how and you started to answer
                this, but how much longer could this last? Or forgive me if I'm
                asking you to speculate, but what do you think? Well, I think
                the fires are going to burn for a little bit longer, but the key
                for us in the US. Is the weather system changing. And so right
                now, it's kind of the weather systems that are pulling that air
                into our mid Atlantic and Northeast region. As those weather
                systems change and shift, we'll see that smoke going elsewhere
                and not impact us in this region as much. And so I think that's
                going to be the defining factor. And I think the next couple of
                days we're going to see a shift in that weather pattern and
                start to push the smoke away from where we are. And finally,
                with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more
                wildfires. Will we be seeing more of these kinds of wide ranging
                air quality consequences or circumstances? I mean, that is one
                of the predictions for climate change. Looking into the future,
                the fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer, and
                we're seeing more frequent fires. So, yeah, this is probably
                something that we'll be seeing more frequently. This tends to be
                much more of an issue in the Western US. So the eastern US.
                Getting hit right now is a little bit new. But yeah, I think
                with climate change moving forward, this is something that is
                going to happen more frequently. That's Peter De Carlo,
                associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health
                and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Sergeant Carlo,
                thanks so much for joining us and sharing this expertise with
                us. Thank you for having me.

                    Good morning. So what is it about the conditions right now
                    that have caused this round of wildfires to affect so many
                    people so far away? Well, there's a couple of things. The
                    season has been pretty dry already, and then the fact that
                    we're getting hit in the US. Is because there's a couple of
                    weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke
                    from those Canadian wildfires through Pennsylvania into the
                    Mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of just dropping the
                    smoke there.
