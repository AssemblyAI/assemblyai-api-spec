Sentiment Analysis detects the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of each sentence in your transcript.

## Enable sentiment analysis

Add `sentiment_analysis: true` to your transcription request:

```bash
curl https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript \
  --header "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "audio_url": "https://assembly.ai/wildfires.mp3",
    "sentiment_analysis": true
  }'
```

## Response format

Each sentence includes a `sentiment` field with one of:
- `POSITIVE`
- `NEGATIVE`
- `NEUTRAL`

Along with a `confidence` score from 0.0 to 1.0.

See the [API Reference](/docs/api-reference) for the full response schema.
