## Choosing the right model

### Universal-3-Pro

Universal 3 Pro is our most advanced transcription model, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across 6 languages with powerful prompting capabilities. It supports prompting in plain language for tasks like context-specific transcription, verbatim output, audio tagging, and speaker diarization, giving you fine-grained control to guide transcription results. With keyterms prompting supporting up to 1,000 words, built-in code switching, and multichannel support, Universal 3 Pro is ideal for complex audio scenarios requiring the highest accuracy.

Supported languages: `en`, `es`, `de`, `fr`, `pt`, `it`
